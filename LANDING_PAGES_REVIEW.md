# Landing Pages Review: Course & Splint Pages
## Analysis & Recommendations for Patient-Focused, Educational-First Approach

---

## Executive Summary

This review analyzes the current messaging and user flow on both the **Course** (`/course`) and **Splint** (`/achilles-rupture-splint`) landing pages, evaluates how they align with the educational email sequence, and provides specific recommendations for improvement.

**Key Finding:** Both pages are well-structured but could better align with the educational-first email flow by:
1. Leading with patient empathy and education before product promotion
2. Better integration of educational content from the email sequence
3. More natural product mentions that feel helpful rather than salesy
4. Stronger connection between the two pages (course ↔ splint)

---

## 2. Value Proposition Presentation

### Course Page Value Proposition

**Primary Value Props:**
1. **Safety & Mistake Prevention** - Avoid re-rupture, permanent weakness
2. **Expert Guidance** - Reviewed by specialists, based on research
3. **Structured Learning** - 31 lessons, week-by-week guidance

**How It's Presented:**

- ✅ Timeline showing benefits at each recovery phase
- ✅ Strong credibility markers
- ⚠️ Missing: Emotional connection to patient journey
- ⚠️ Missing: Free educational content (email course) as trust builder

### Splint Page Value Proposition

**Primary Value Props:**
1. **Sleep Comfort** - "Finally, a comfortable solution"
2. **Lightweight** - 200g vs 1.5kg+ boot (90% lighter)
3. **Breathability** - Open design vs enclosed boot
4. **Cleanliness** - No dirt in bed
5. **Safety** - Same protection at 30° angle

**How It's Presented:**

- ✅ Strong social proof
- ⚠️ Missing: Educational context about why sleep matters for recovery
- ⚠️ Missing: Connection to broader recovery journey

## 3. Alignment with Email Flow Recommendations

### Email Flow Philosophy (from EMAIL_SEQUENCE_ANALYSIS.md)

**Core Principles:**
1. **Educational-first** - Pure education in early emails (Days 0-3)
2. **Contextual product mentions** - Products introduced when they solve real problems
3. **Empathetic tone** - Acknowledges difficulty, provides reassurance
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Build trust before promoting products

### Current Alignment Issues

#### Course Page
- ❌ **Missing:** Reference to free email course (builds trust before paid course)
- ❌ **Missing:** Empathetic opening acknowledging injury difficulty
- ⚠️ **Partial:** Educational content is present but feels transactional
- ✅ **Good:** Safety-focused messaging aligns with email content

#### Splint Page
- ❌ **Missing:** Educational context before product promotion
- ❌ **Missing:** Connection to email course content (sleep struggles mentioned in Email 6)
- ⚠️ **Partial:** Product mentions are contextual (sleep, washing) but page doesn't build educational foundation first
- ✅ **Good:** Comparison table aligns with Email 6's boot education

### Opportunities for Better Alignment

1. **Add Educational Pre-Content**
   - Both pages should start with educational value before product promotion
   - Reference email course content to build trust

2. **Cross-Promote Naturally**
   - Course page: Mention splint when discussing sleep challenges
   - Splint page: Mention course when discussing recovery timeline

3. **Empathetic Opening**
   - Acknowledge injury difficulty before offering solutions
   - Match the tone of Email 1: "First of all, sorry about your injury"

---

## 4. How Landing Pages Complement Email Flow

### Current Complement

**Email Flow → Landing Pages:**
- ✅ Email 1 mentions course link → Course page exists
- ✅ Email 4 & 6 mention splint → Splint page exists
- ✅ Email content educates → Landing pages provide deeper product info

**Landing Pages → Email Flow:**
- ⚠️ **Missing:** Landing pages don't promote email course signup
- ⚠️ **Missing:** No clear path from landing pages to email sequence
- ⚠️ **Missing:** Landing pages don't reference email content

### Ideal Complement

**Email Flow should:**
- Educate and build trust (Days 0-10)
- Introduce products contextually (Day 9+)
- Link to landing pages for deeper product info

**Landing Pages should:**
- Provide educational foundation before product promotion
- Reference email course content to build credibility
- Offer email course signup as trust-building first step
- Cross-promote products naturally within educational context

## 5. Specific Improvement Recommendations

### Course Page Improvements

#### 1. **Add Empathetic Hero Opening**
**Current:** "Master Your Achilles Recovery"
**Recommended:** 
```
"Recovering from an Achilles rupture is hard. We're here to help."

[Then transition to value prop]
```

**Rationale:** Matches Email 1's empathetic tone, builds emotional connection before educational content.

#### 2. **Add Free Email Course Section**
**Location:** After hero, before "Common Mistakes"
**Content:**
- "Start with our free email course"
- "11 emails over 70 days covering your recovery journey"
- "Get bite-sized guidance delivered to your inbox"
- Signup CTA

**Rationale:** Builds trust before paid course, aligns with educational-first approach.

#### 3. **Reference Email Content**
**Location:** In timeline section
**Content:** 
- "If you're following our free email course, this lesson expands on Email 6's boot protocol guidance"
- Link to relevant email content where applicable

**Rationale:** Creates natural connection between free and paid content.

#### 4. **Add Sleep Challenge Context**
**Location:** In Week 2-6 timeline section
**Content:**
- Mention sleep struggles (80% of patients)
- Natural mention of splint as solution
- Link to splint page

**Rationale:** Contextual product mention that feels helpful, not salesy.

#### 5. **Soften "Master Your" Language**
**Current:** "Master Your Achilles Recovery"
**Recommended:** "Navigate Your Achilles Recovery" or "Recover Safely from Your Achilles Rupture"

**Rationale:** Less achievement-oriented, more supportive and patient-focused.

---

### Splint Page Improvements

#### 1. **Add Educational Opening Section**
**Location:** Before hero section
**Content:**
- "Why Sleep Matters During Recovery"
- Brief educational content about sleep's role in healing
- Reference to Email 6's sleep guidance
- Then transition to: "That's why we created..."

**Rationale:** Educational foundation before product promotion, aligns with email flow.

#### 2. **Soften "The Only" Claim**
**Current:** "The Only Splint for Achilles Tendon Rupture"
**Recommended:** "A Comfortable Splint Designed for Achilles Rupture Recovery" or "Sleep Better During Your Achilles Recovery"

**Rationale:** Less marketing claim, more helpful description.

#### 3. **Add Recovery Context Section**
**Location:** After comparison table, before athlete endorsements
**Content:**
- "Where This Fits in Your Recovery"
- Timeline showing when splint is used (Weeks 0-12)
- Connection to broader recovery journey
- Link to course for full recovery guidance

**Rationale:** Positions product within educational framework, not as standalone solution.

#### 4. **Reference Email Course**
**Location:** In "Who This Is For" section
**Content:**
- "If you're following our free email course, this splint addresses the sleep challenges discussed in Email 6"
- Link to email course signup

**Rationale:** Natural cross-promotion, builds trust through educational connection.

#### 5. **Add Educational Content About Sleep**
**Location:** New section before "What to Expect Next Morning"
**Content:**
- "Why Sleep Quality Matters"
- Brief explanation of sleep's role in healing
- Common sleep challenges with boot
- How splint addresses these challenges

**Rationale:** Educational value before product benefits, aligns with email flow philosophy.

#### 6. **Improve Product Introduction Timing**
**Current:** Product featured immediately in hero
**Recommended:** 
- Educational content first (sleep challenges)
- Then product introduction: "That's why we created the Thetis Night Splint"
- Then product details

**Rationale:** Problem-first, solution-second approach matches email flow.

---

### Cross-Page Improvements

#### 1. **Add Cross-Promotion Sections**

**On Course Page:**
- Section: "Essential Recovery Tools"
- Mention splint when discussing sleep (Week 2-6 section)
- Link to splint page

**On Splint Page:**
- Section: "Your Complete Recovery Plan"
- Mention course when discussing recovery timeline
- Link to course page

**Rationale:** Natural product mentions within educational context.

#### 2. **Unified Educational Messaging**

**Both Pages Should:**
- Start with patient empathy
- Provide educational value before product promotion
- Reference email course content
- Use consistent tone (supportive, educational, helpful)

**Rationale:** Creates cohesive brand experience aligned with email flow.

#### 3. **Email Course Signup Prominence**

**Both Pages Should Feature:**
- Prominent email course signup (above fold or early in page)
- Clear value proposition: "Get free recovery guidance delivered to your inbox"
- Trust builder before paid products

**Rationale:** Educational-first approach, builds trust before conversion.

### Recommended Tone

**Both Pages Should:**

**Example Tone Shifts:**

| Current | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| "Master Your Achilles Recovery" | "Navigate Your Achilles Recovery Safely" |
| "The Only Splint" | "A Comfortable Splint for Sleep During Recovery" |
| "Start Your Safe Recovery →" | "Get the Guidance You Need →" |

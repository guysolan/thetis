  - paragraph: When I tore my own Achilles tendon, the hardest part of the recovery was having to wear the hospital boot in bed at night for many weeks. My only option was to make myself a splint using plaster-cast materials and make-shift straps. It is fantastic that Thetis Medical have produced this night-splint. It is certain to improve the recovery experience for patients.

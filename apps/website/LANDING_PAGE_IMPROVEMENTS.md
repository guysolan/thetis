1. **Making "Who We Are" clearer** - Establishing credibility and trust upfront
2. **Improving conversion rates** - Optimizing the path from visitor to customer

## Current Page Structure Analysis

**Current Flow:**

1. LandingHero (Hook)
2. Reviews (Social Proof)

4. ThetisMythology (Brand Story - "Who We Are")
5. WhatWeOffer (Products + Education)
6. ProfessionalOpinionsCarousel (Expert Endorsements)

- "Who We Are" comes after social proof, which may reduce impact
- No clear founder/team story or credentials
- Missing explicit trust indicators (years in business, certifications, etc.)
- Product benefits could be more prominent earlier
- Call-to-action hierarchy could be clearer

---

## 1. Making "Who We Are" Clearer

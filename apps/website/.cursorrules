# Thetis Medical Website - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview

This is an Astro-based medical website for Thetis Medical, focused on Achilles rupture recovery products and educational content.

## Code Style & Formatting

### Astro Files

- Wrap imports in `---` frontmatter blocks
- Use multi-line formatting for long strings (descriptions, etc.)
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes with proper spacing and ordering
- Use `class` attribute formatting that breaks long class lists across lines

### Component Patterns

- Use the existing CTA components: `EmailCTA.astro`, `CourseCTA.astro`, `NightSplintAdvert.astro`
- Layouts should be in `/src/layouts/` - prefer `FAQsLayout.astro` for FAQ/guide content
- Components should support the `lang` prop for internationalization (Lang type from `@/config/languages`)

### Lead Magnets & CTAs

- **Primary lead magnet**: Email course signup (NOT the eBook)
- Use `EmailCTA` component for lead magnet sections
- Use `CourseCTA` for upselling paid courses (Essentials £29, Professionals £99)
- The email course is FREE and timed to injury date

## Content Structure

### Recovery Guide Phases

The site has 7 recovery phases with detailed guides at `/guide/[slug]`:

1. `weeks-0-1` - Week 0-1: First Week After Rupture
2. `weeks-1-3` - Weeks 1-3: Treatment Decision  
3. `weeks-4-6` - Weeks 4-6: Progressive Recovery
4. `weeks-7-9` - Weeks 7-9: Final Boot Phase
5. `weeks-10-12` - Weeks 10-12: Boot Transition
6. `weeks-13-25` - Weeks 13-25: Progressive Strengthening
7. `week-26-plus` - Week 26+: Return to Sport

When referencing timeline/recovery content, link to these detailed guides.

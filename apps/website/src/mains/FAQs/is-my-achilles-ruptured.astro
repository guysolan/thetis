            <p>
                If you get sudden sharp pain in the back of the heel, sometimes
                with an audible snapping sound, then you may have torn the
                Achilles tendon. For what happens next, see <a
                    href="/FAQs/what-happens-if-my-achilles-is-ruptured"
                    class="text-primary underline"
                    >what happens after an Achilles rupture</a
                >. You should assume that is the case until you are sure it is a
                less serious injury. You may be tempted think you have just
                sprained your ankle. There are several myths about what is and
                is not possible to do with your leg after you have suffered a
                tear to the Achilles tendon, and sometimes this leads to a
                delayed diagnosis. Even with a torn Achilles you can move the
                foot (other tendons help to do this) and you can still walk
                (albeit awkwardly). Sometimes people seek help after a delay,
                having initially hoped that the injury was something more minor
                and would recover quickly.
            </p>
            <div id="q2"></div>
            <h2>What happens when you tear your Achilles?</h2>
            <p>
                The Achilles tendon joins the calf muscles to the heel bone. It
                is important for standing up on tip toes and pushing off when
                you walk. If it tears, then the muscle is no longer connected to
                the heel and so the ankle movement is weak.
            </p>
            <div id="q3"></div>

            <h2>How to tell if your Achilles tendon is about to tear?</h2>
            <p>
                Most ruptures of the Achilles happen suddenly with no warning at
                all. The reasons for this are not well understood, but
                susceptibility to rupture may relate to poor blood supply to the
                tendon. Most patients with a rupture report that they have never
                had any previous Achilles trouble (such as tendinitis /
                tendinopathy).
            </p>
            <div id="q4"></div>

            <h2>How do you tear your Achilles?</h2>
            <p>
                Pushing off with your foot causes a strong and sudden
                contraction of the calf muscle which proves to be too much for
                the tendon. The tendon is made of millions of hairs that run
                like a horse's tail from the calf muscle to the heel bone. Why
                the tendon should suddenly fail is not well understood. Each
                fibre tears at a different point, so the tear is not clean but
                results in two ragged ends.

            <h2>How do Achilles tears happen?</h2>
            <p>
                The type of injury can be any sudden push-off using the ankle.
                The classical stereotype is of a middle-aged person returning to
                sport. Pushing a heavy object or (particularly in older
                individuals) just an awkward stumble can be enough.

            <h2>What else it could be?</h2>
            <!-- <a class='bait' href='#top'><p>Included in the full guide, available by email.</p></a> -->

            <p>
                A torn calf muscle (tennis leg) is a different injury where
                sudden pain develops, but in the middle of the calf rather than
                low down by the heel. Like a torn Achilles this can be suddenly
                very painful. A tearing or snapping feeling is common. This
                injury is much less severe than an Achilles rupture.
            </p>
            <div id="q7"></div>

            <p>
                Usually, you experience a sudden pain in the back of your leg.
                You might hear a snap. Sometimes other people hear it too. Often
                the rupture happens during sport. You might think that an
                opponent has kicked you or your tennis partner hit you with
                their racquet.
            </p>

            <h2>How painful is a torn Achilles?</h2>
            <!-- <a class='bait' href='#top'><p>Included in the full guide, available by email.</p></a> -->

            <p>
                The pain is instantaneously quite severe but settles down
                quickly. The absence of lasting pain makes some people believe
                (hope) that nothing too serious has happened.
            </p>
            <div id="q9"></div>

            <h2>How do you know if you tore your Achilles?</h2>
            <!-- <a class='bait' href='#top'><p>Included in the full guide, available by email.</p></a> -->

            <p>
                Sudden pain in the back of the heel, often with an accompanying
                snapping sound. The pain subsides quickly. You can still move
                your toes and ankle. You can still stand and walk/limp. You
                cannot stand onto tip toes on just the injured leg.
            </p>
            <div id="q10"></div>

            <h2>Should I go to hospital?</h2>
            <!-- <a class='bait' href='#top'><p>Included in the full guide, available by email.</p></a> -->

            <p>
                If you are in doubt, seek medical advice and have the injury
                checked. Limping around hoping it will get better means a delay
                in diagnosis and a greater chance that surgical repair will be
                needed.
            </p>

                Properly treated Achilles tendon ruptures heal well, but
                recovery is lengthy. You can expect to be in a boot or similar
                support for your leg for about 10 weeks. After this it takes
                months to regain the muscle strength. If you ask someone who has
                been through this they will say that they were limited in
                activities for at least 6 months and that full recovery takes
                about a year.

            <p>
                Between 0.01% and 0.02% of the population tear their Achilles
                every year. In the UK it is estimated that there are 11,000
                confirmed cases per year. In the US the estimate is 59 000.

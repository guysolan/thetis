      "I recently began using the Thetis Splint overnight. My regular boot is good for daily use but very heavy and uncomfortable to sleep in - the splint has been revolutionary for me! It keeps my foot perfectly in place but without being bulky, meaning I can sleep more comfortably with no fear of hurting my Achilles tendon. I would highly recommend everyone and anyone to use this product during your recovery from Achilles rupture.",

      "The Thetis Splint is a lot slimmer and far more lightweight than the orthopaedic boot I was sleeping in. It allows me to move my leg more freely but still stops me from flexing my toes beyond a certain point, which is ideal whilst the tendon heals. The splint even comes in my favourite colour, so I was sold the minute I saw it!",

      "The Thetis Splint has a simple design that is perfectly fit for purpose. It has allowed me to get the sleep that is so vital as I recovered from achilles tendon rupture and surgery whilst also feeling secure and protected. Apart from being less bulky than the orthopaedic boot, it also gives the surgical wounds a chance to breath and has made the recovery period a lot more bearable. I would highly recommend this product!",

    body:
      "After my Achilles tendon rupture surgery, I was advised by a specialist to invest in a Thetis splint as the best product to use as part of my recovery.\n\nThe difference between sleeping in a big bulky boot and the Thetis splint was an absolute saviour. It made sleeping at night so much better and easier, and helped with my recovery as I was fresh because of better sleep. It kept my foot at the right angle and was light enough that I didn't notice it while asleep!\n\nI would and have recommended this product to my other teammates who have ruptured their Achilles tendon!",

        `If you've ruptured your Achilles tendon... Commiserations! It's not fun. And it's not a quick recovery. You will have been given a Controlled Ankle Movement (CAM) boot and, after wearing it all day, there's no respite at night. Like me, you might find that sleeping in the boot is even harder than walking in it. It's hot. Things you don't notice during the day suddenly become impossible to ignore: a bit of pressure here, a bit of rubbing there. And you can't sleep. This is exactly what the night splint is designed to solve. And it works.

As others have noted, the splint is not cheap, but it's a niche product, made by a small company, and there's little scope for economies of scale. You're paying for the expertise that went into its design too. In my view, it's worth every penny. It took me a bit of fiddling around making minor adjustments to the position and tightness of the straps to get it comfortable. It's a case of balancing security and comfort. I prioritised security and, the first night, I had tightened the strap that goes under the foot a little too much and, as a result, the splint was pressing on the top of my foot too much for a whole night's comfort. I was also concerned that the strap at the heel might cause problems, but it hasn't. In the end, I've found that I'm actually having the heel strap a little tighter than the calf and foot straps and that's got the balance between security and comfort about right. I've still found that a cotton wool make-up pad, half under the splint, at the edge nearest my small, outer toes helps: everyone's feet are different and I found that was a bit of a pressure point. However, it's worth the effort: I've been able to sleep well and the splint has remained secure. The recovery of my Achilles tendon remains on track too.

In summary, then, this has been a very worthwhile purchase. It's a good example of a small company that's identified a problem and provided a solution. (Note: the Thetis website is also an excellent source of information about Achilles tendon injuries and recovery.) I would also suggest searching for the Evenup Shoe Balancer on Amazon: another helpful product but one that makes walking with a CAM boot a bit easier.`,

        `Ruptured Achilles is hard. And recovery is very long. I’ve never had “total bed rest” before. This night brace as been a savior: I can sleep and rest comfortably. It is light, cool and easy to put on.

Far preferable to (not) sleeping in The Boot. Sleep is critical to recovery.

It’s not cheap, but worth the price for a well designed niche medical product. Other reviewers have some negative comments about design and comfort. I don’t agree. Strapping a sensitive injured foot into a brace is not a usual thing and some minor strap adjustments relieved discomfort.

I did consult with my Orthopedic Surgeon, as Thetis recommended. Since my surgeon also has an MA in engineering, after the caveats about not “touching down”, gave approval.

2 weeks post surgery I’ve combined the Thetis night brace with the IWalk Hands Free crutch around the house. I can cook, clean, carry stuff in both hands and be a little less of an imposition on my spouse. Still use The Boot when I have to “gimp out” to run unavoidable errands. Prior to this injury I was very active, with decent balance and leg strength. All necessary for the above combination.

Finally: be patient. Recovery from an Achilles Rupture takes time.`,

        `I ruptured my achilles and spent 3 weeks "In the boot" before I finally gave in with lack of sleep and started to research products like this.

I was swayed by the positive reviews on this product and took the plunge, it has genuinely been the single best decision I have made in my recovery so far, its light, easy to fit and comfortable (as long as you don't overtighten the straps). My physio has said this is fine to use when resting/sleeping but obviously not for weight bearing (which is stated *in bold*, in the instructions).

If you're struggling to sleep in your heavy achilles boot and your significant other is fed up of being knocked and poked by the cumbersome boot then I'd definitely recommend purchasing one of these.`,

In order for Achilles tendon ruptures to heal correctly having your foot in this position, early on after injury is imperative. I’m not a doctor, but that’s What doctor say. I tried the splint Against my skin, but after wearing a while, it starts to bother my foot a bit. So I wear a sock underneath it and it works perfect",

        "Although this splint is intended for night use only. I used it day and night for immobilization in my first 4 weeks after Achilles repair. I used this to replace the slab my surgeon put me on after surgery. Its convenient, comfortable, well ventilated whilst providing adequate support to put my ankle in place. I certainly recommend this product over cast or slab after achilles repair if the surgeon prefers non weight bearing early post op.",

        "This damn thing is my new bestie!! I am SO thankful to have found it. I am a light sleeper to begin with and the boot was making sleep impossible! It felt like a torture chamber at night. At the 2 week mark (non-op) my Dr. approved this, and I am sleeping 6-8 hours a night which is my norm. I have read people think it is too expensive??? It is priceless! Some say it is a bit uncomfortable, but if you add a nice thick wool sock under it, you will quickly adjust to the slight discomfort. Seriously, if you are struggling with the boot at night, treat yourself with this wonderful device!!!",

Highly recommend if you are in the recovery stage of an achilles rupture post-op and out of the cast.",

        "I completely ruptured my achilles and had surgery. I didn’t get any sleep for the first 1 1/2 months in my heavy boot. Plus deep cleaning it every night before bed got so old. I decided to buy this so I could try to get some sleep the last month in my boot! I have been sleeping so much better! I personally wouldn’t recommend using this until a wedge has come out of your boot. I think you’ll need more support than this product can offer right after surgery. But I think switching over to this nighttime brace about halfway through the boot recovery time felt pretty safe and comfortable. I wear a sock with it for comfort. I wish it was cheaper, but it definitely helps me get some sleep! 2 more weeks until I’m back in my shoes with a heel lift!! I hope this helps someone going through this recovery! Good luck and quick healing!",

Länger als eine Stunde am Stück schlafen und mit ständigen Positionswechseln und Druckschmerzen waren die Nächte eine reine Qual. Zum Glück habe ich dann diese Schiene bei Amazon entdeckt. Klar ist es ein Nieschenprodukt und klar ist der Preis angesichts der verbauten Materialien viel zu hoch und trotzdem ist mir die Schiene jeden Cent wert, denn sie war der Gamechanger für meine Nächte:) Endlich geschützt und trotzdem recht frei schlafen zu können, war eine wahre Wohltat für meinen Schlaf:) wichtig… die Schiene korrekt anzulegen, aber die Klettverschlüsse nicht zu fest zu zurren, da man sonst nachts ebenfalls starke Schmerzen bekommt. Sollte in allen Sanitätshäusern im Regal liegen und auch empfohlen werden, denn guter Schlaf trägt erheblich zur Regeneration und Heilung bei :)",

        `This splint has proved the difference between a good nights sleep and barely any sleep at all. Wearing it at other odd times that boot is inconvenient also gives me confidence that I won't unexpectedly pull my foot upwards.

This is a recent, unique product and maybe future iterations will use more comfortable materials but after a weeks use it's felt quite natural. I wasn't sure initially about one of the upper spur of the heel strap, specifically whether it was pulling on the tendon. However not pulling this strap too tight has made this is a non issue. I'm a size 8 so just at the mid point and a large has felt fine.`,

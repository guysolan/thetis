                "The Achilles tendon, the strongest and largest tendon in the human body, plays a critical role in locomotion by connecting the calf muscles to the heel bone. This robust structure is essential for activities such as walking, running, and jumping, bearing loads up to 12 times body weight during running.",
                "Despite its strength, the Achilles tendon is susceptible to rupture, a common musculoskeletal injury that can result in significant morbidity. Achilles tendon rupture typically occurs due to sudden, forceful plantarflexion or dorsiflexion of the foot, often during sports participation involving rapid acceleration, deceleration, or changes in direction.",
                "The management of Achilles tendon rupture has evolved over time, with primary treatment options including surgical repair and non-surgical management. This report analyzes the global trends in the incidence of Achilles tendon ruptures and the corresponding shifts in treatment approaches across various countries.",

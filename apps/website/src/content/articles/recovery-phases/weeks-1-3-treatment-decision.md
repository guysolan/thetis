# Weeks 1-3: Making Your Treatment Decision - Surgery or Conservative Care

You've survived the first chaotic days after your Achilles rupture. Now comes one of the most important decisions in your recovery: surgery or non-surgical treatment? This guide will help you understand your options, what happens at your specialist appointment, and how to set yourself up for success in these crucial early weeks.

## The Specialist Consultation

### What Happens at Your Orthopaedic Appointment

Your specialist appointment (typically at a fracture clinic or orthopaedic outpatients) is a pivotal moment in your recovery. Here's what to expect:

**Before the appointment:**

- Bring someone with you if possible - there's a lot of information to absorb
- Write down any questions you have
- Be prepared to discuss your activity level, occupation, and recovery goals
- Wear loose trousers or shorts for easy examination

**During the appointment:**

1. **History review:** The specialist will ask about how the injury happened, your symptoms, and your general health

2. **Physical examination:** They'll examine your ankle, feel for the gap in the tendon, and perform specific tests

3. **Discussion of findings:** You'll learn about the severity of your rupture and treatment options

4. **Treatment decision:** Together, you'll decide on the best approach for you

5. **Boot fitting:** If you're not already in a boot, you'll likely be fitted for one

6. **Follow-up plan:** You'll receive a schedule of appointments and rehabilitation milestones

### Physical Examination: The Thompson/Simmonds Test

The Thompson test (also called the Simmonds test) is the key clinical test for Achilles rupture:

**How it works:**

- You lie face-down on the examination couch with your feet hanging off the end
- The doctor squeezes your calf muscle firmly
- In a healthy tendon, this makes your foot point downward (plantarflex)
- In a ruptured tendon, the foot barely moves or doesn't move at all

[GRAPHIC: Diagram showing Thompson test - positive vs negative result]

**Other examination findings:**

- A palpable gap in the tendon (you can often feel this yourself)
- Increased passive dorsiflexion (your foot can be pushed up more than normal)
- Weakness when trying to point your toes
- Swelling and bruising around the heel and ankle

### Imaging - Ultrasound vs MRI (When and Why)

Not everyone needs imaging, but it's increasingly common and can be very helpful:

**Ultrasound (most common):**

- Quick, painless, and widely available
- Shows whether the tendon ends are close together or have a gap
- Helps determine if non-surgical treatment is suitable
- Can check for blood clots in the leg veins at the same time
- Cost-effective

**MRI (less common):**

- Provides more detailed images
- Usually reserved for complex cases or when ultrasound is inconclusive
- Takes longer and may have waiting lists
- Used more frequently in the USA (70% of cases) than the UK (15% of cases)

**Key information from imaging:**

- The size of any gap between tendon ends
- Whether the tendon ends will come together in a pointed foot position
- The overall quality of the tendon tissue

If ultrasound shows the tendon ends come together well when your foot is pointed down, non-surgical treatment is usually an excellent option.

## Surgery vs Non-Surgical Treatment - The Facts

This is the big question. Let's break down what the evidence actually says.

### What Does Surgery Involve?

Surgical repair of the Achilles tendon involves:

**The procedure:**

- General or regional anaesthesia
- An incision at the back of the ankle (3-10cm depending on technique)
- The torn tendon ends are stitched back together
- The wound is closed and dressed
- You're placed in a cast or boot

**Types of surgery:**

- **Open repair:** Traditional approach with a longer incision (~80% of UK surgeries)
- **Minimally invasive/percutaneous:** Smaller incisions with special instruments (~20% and growing)

**Recovery after surgery:**

- 1-2 weeks in a cast, then a walking boot
- Same rehabilitation protocol as non-surgical treatment
- Total recovery time: 6-12 months (same as non-surgical)

**Risks of surgery:**

- Wound infection (2-4%)
- Wound healing problems
- Nerve damage causing numbness
- Sural nerve injury
- Blood clots
- Scar tissue
- Re-rupture (still possible, though slightly lower rate)

### What Does Non-Surgical Treatment Involve?

Non-surgical (conservative) treatment involves:

**The approach:**

- Wearing a walking boot with heel wedges for approximately 10 weeks
- The foot is initially held in a pointed position (equinus)
- Wedges are gradually removed to bring the foot towards neutral
- Weight-bearing is encouraged from early on
- Physiotherapy typically starts around weeks 9-12

**How it works:**

- The tendon ends heal naturally when held in the right position
- The body forms scar tissue that bridges the gap
- This healed tendon is just as strong as a surgically repaired one

**Benefits of non-surgical treatment:**

- No surgical risks (infection, wound problems, nerve damage)
- No anaesthesia required
- Often faster initial recovery
- Lower overall complication rate
- Equally good long-term outcomes for most people

### Re-rupture Rates: The Real Numbers (3.7% vs 9.8%)

This is where the numbers get interesting:

**Historical data suggested:**

- Surgical repair: ~3.7% re-rupture rate
- Non-surgical treatment: ~9.8% re-rupture rate

**But modern protocols have changed this:**

- When non-surgical treatment includes early weight-bearing and functional rehabilitation, re-rupture rates drop dramatically
- The difference between surgical and non-surgical re-rupture rates is now as low as 1.6%
- Some modern non-surgical protocols report re-rupture rates below 5%

**The key factors that reduce re-rupture risk:**

- Early functional weight-bearing in a boot (not prolonged casting)
- Proper boot positioning (maintaining equinus)
- Compliance with wearing the boot 24/7
- Following the rehabilitation protocol carefully
- Not rushing back to high-impact activities

### The UKSTAR Trial - What It Proved

The UKSTAR trial (UK Study of Treatment for Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture) was a landmark study that changed how we treat Achilles ruptures.

**What the trial found:**

Comparing plaster casting vs functional bracing (boot with early weight-bearing):

- **No significant difference** in long-term outcomes between surgical and non-surgical treatment
- Functional bracing allowed faster return to normal activities
- Lower complication rates with non-surgical treatment
- Significant cost savings with non-surgical approach

**The recommendation:**
> "Early weight-bearing in a functional brace is a safe and cost-effective alternative to plaster casting" - UKSTAR Trial, Lancet 2020

**What this means for you:**

- Non-surgical treatment with a walking boot is the first-line treatment for most people
- Surgery is reserved for specific circumstances
- Early weight-bearing and functional rehabilitation are key to success

## Your Walking Boot - The Foundation of Recovery

### Aircast vs VACOped - Which Boot is Best?

The two most common boots are the Aircast and VACOped. Both can provide excellent outcomes, but they work differently.

**Aircast Boot:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Mechanism | Fixed wedges that are removed over time |
| Cost | £121-150 (+ £20-25 for wedges) |
| Availability | Widely available |
| Ankle position | ~28° plantarflexion |
| Waterproof | No - needs a cover |

**Pros:**

- Lightweight
- Inexpensive
- Easy to adjust
- Widely used and familiar to clinicians

**Cons:**

- May not achieve optimal ankle positioning
- Fixed positions between wedge changes
- Not waterproof
- Can cause some gait abnormalities

**VACOped Boot:**

| Feature | Details |
| ------- | ------- |
| Mechanism | Hinged, adjustable range of motion |
| Cost | £250-350 |
| Availability | Limited to some centres |
| Ankle position | ~48° plantarflexion |
| Waterproof | Yes (with liner modification) |

**Pros:**

- Potentially better ankle positioning
- Allows controlled movement within safe range
- May preserve muscle better
- Waterproof capability
- More natural walking pattern (once hinge unlocked)

**Cons:**

- Expensive
- More complex to adjust
- Not available everywhere
- Thicker base can feel awkward

[GRAPHIC: Side-by-side comparison of Aircast and VACOped boots]

**The bottom line:** Both boots can produce excellent outcomes. Use whatever your hospital provides and follow the protocol carefully. The commitment to wearing it properly matters more than which brand you have.

### Understanding Wedges and Angle Progression

Your foot needs to be held in a pointed position (plantarflexion/equinus) to allow the tendon to heal at the correct length.

**Typical progression:**

| Week | Aircast Wedges | Approximate Angle |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-2 | 4 wedges | ~28-30° |
| 3-4 | 3 wedges | ~22° |
| 5-6 | 2 wedges | ~16° |
| 7-8 | 1 wedge | ~10° |
| 9-10 | 0 wedges | Neutral |

**Why this matters:**

- Too much angle = foot pointed too far down, uncomfortable but safe
- Too little angle = tendon ends not close together, risk of elongation
- **It's better to be too pointed than not enough**

Your specialist will give you a specific schedule for wedge removal. Follow it exactly.

### Fitting Your Boot Correctly

A properly fitted boot is essential. Here's what to check:

**Sizing:**

- The boot should fit snugly without being tight
- Your toes should not press against the front
- The heel should sit securely in the heel cup
- Most boots come in S/M/L sizes

**Strap tension:**

- Straps should be firm but not cutting off circulation
- You should be able to slide one finger under each strap
- Re-tighten straps throughout the day as needed

**Wedge placement:**

- Wedges go under the heel, not the whole foot
- Stack them according to your protocol
- Make sure they're secure and not shifting

**Common problems:**

- Foot sliding forward = straps too loose or wedges incorrectly placed
- Toe pain = foot sliding or boot too small
- Pressure sores = straps too tight or poor fit

## Living with Your Boot - Weeks 1-3

### Learning to Walk with Crutches and Boot

In weeks 1-3, you'll be getting used to walking in your boot, likely still with crutches for support.

**Walking technique:**

- Most protocols allow partial weight-bearing from early on
- Use crutches for balance and support, not to keep all weight off
- Aim for a heel-to-toe rolling motion
- Keep the boot on for all walking - no exceptions

**Progression:**

- Week 1-2: Crutches with light weight-bearing
- Week 2-3: Gradually increasing weight through the boot
- By week 3-4: Many people can walk without crutches (but keep them handy)

**Tips:**

- Start with short distances and build up
- Rest when you need to
- Swelling after walking is normal - elevate afterwards
- Use a shoe leveler on your other foot to prevent back pain

### Weight-Bearing Guidelines

Weight-bearing protocols vary between hospitals, but the trend is towards early weight-bearing because research shows it improves outcomes.

**Common approaches:**

- **Immediate weight-bearing as tolerated:** Put as much weight through the boot as feels comfortable
- **Progressive weight-bearing:** Start at 25%, increase to 50%, then full weight over 2-4 weeks
- **Non-weight-bearing then progression:** Some older protocols still use this

**What "weight-bearing as tolerated" means:**

- Listen to your body
- Some discomfort is normal; sharp pain is not
- Use crutches for balance and confidence
- Gradually put more weight through as you feel ready

**Signs you're progressing well:**

- Decreasing reliance on crutches
- Increasing walking distance
- Swelling manageable with elevation
- No sharp pain

### The Importance of 24/7 Protection

This cannot be emphasised enough: **Your boot must be worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week** during these early weeks.

**Why 24/7 protection matters:**

- One moment of unprotected dorsiflexion (foot bending up) can pull the healing tendon ends apart
- This could cause the tendon to heal elongated (stretched out), reducing your final power
- In the worst case, it could cause a re-rupture

**The only exceptions:**

- Showering (with specialist approval and extreme caution)
- Physiotherapy exercises (when prescribed, much later)
- Using a night splint (when approved by your specialist)

**Recovery is like Snakes and Ladders:** Each week sees you closer to the finish. But one small mistake is like landing on the big snake - taking you right back to the beginning.

## Sleep Solutions During the Boot Phase

### Why Sleeping in a Boot is Miserable

Let's be honest: sleeping in a walking boot is one of the most challenging aspects of recovery. Common complaints include:

- The boot is heavy and awkward
- Your foot gets hot and sweaty
- You can't move or change position easily
- The boot makes the sheets dirty
- It's just plain uncomfortable

Unfortunately, protecting your tendon overnight is absolutely essential. One accidental stretch during sleep could undo weeks of healing.

### The Night Splint Alternative

A night splint designed specifically for Achilles rupture can be a game-changer for sleep comfort.

**The Thetis Night Splint:**

- Specifically designed for Achilles tendon rupture
- Holds your foot in the correct plantarflexed position
- Lightweight and breathable
- Much more comfortable than a boot for sleeping
- Clinically endorsed by leading surgeons

**When can you use it?**

- Typically from week 2-4 onwards (check with your specialist)
- Must wait for any surgical wounds to heal first
- Only for sleeping/resting - not for walking

**What surgeons say:**
> "It is fantastic that Thetis Medical have produced this night-splint. It is certain to improve the recovery experience for patients." - Mr. James Davis, Past President BOFAS

[PRODUCT LINK: Thetis Night Splint]

**Important:** Do NOT use a generic "night splint" designed for plantar fasciitis. These hold the foot in the wrong position (dorsiflexion) and could damage your healing tendon. Only use a splint specifically designed for Achilles rupture.

### Tips for Actually Getting Rest

Whether you're in a boot or night splint, here are strategies for better sleep:

**Position:**

- Sleep on your back with your leg elevated on pillows
- Or on your side with a pillow between your legs
- Avoid sleeping on your stomach

**Environment:**

- Keep the room cool (your foot will be warm)
- Use breathable sheets
- Consider a fan directed at your feet

**Practical tips:**

- Wear a thin cotton sock under the boot for comfort
- Keep crutches next to the bed
- Use a nightlight for bathroom trips
- Empty your bladder before bed (fewer night-time trips)
- Limit fluids in the evening

**Mental approach:**

- Accept that sleep will be disrupted for a while
- Rest even if you can't sleep deeply
- Nap during the day if needed
- This phase is temporary

- Coughing up blood
- Rapid heartbeat
- Feeling faint

**If you experience PE symptoms, call 999 immediately.**

### Signs of Infection (Post-Surgery)

If you've had surgery, watch for:

- Increasing redness around the wound
- Wound becoming hot to touch
- Pus or unusual discharge
- Fever
- Wound opening up
- Increasing pain after initial improvement

Contact your surgical team if you notice any of these signs.

### When to Call Your Doctor

Contact your medical team if you experience:

- Suspected blood clot symptoms
- Signs of infection
- Sudden increase in pain
- Your boot or cast becomes loose or damaged
- You have a fall or accident
- Your foot slips out of position
- Numbness or tingling that doesn't resolve
- Concerns about your medication

## FAQs for Weeks 1-3

### Surgery was recommended - should I be worried?

Not necessarily. Surgery is sometimes recommended for specific reasons:

- A significant gap between tendon ends
- Very active lifestyle/professional athlete
- Previous Achilles problems
- Certain tendon characteristics on imaging

If surgery is recommended, ask your surgeon to explain why and discuss the risks and benefits for your specific situation.

### My friend had surgery and says I should too - what should I do?

Listen to your medical team, not anecdotes. Every rupture is different, and what was right for your friend may not be right for you. The evidence strongly supports non-surgical treatment for most people.

### Can I walk on my heel with the boot?

Yes, when walking in the boot, you should walk as normally as possible with a heel-to-toe motion. The boot is designed to protect your tendon while allowing walking.

### How often should I take the boot off?

In weeks 1-3, the boot should stay on 24/7. The only exceptions are:

- Brief periods for showering (with extreme care)
- Using a night splint (if approved by your specialist)
- Specific exercises prescribed by your physiotherapist (not usually this early)

### When can I stop using crutches?

This varies by individual, but many people can reduce crutch use by weeks 2-3 and stop using them by weeks 3-4. Always follow your specific protocol and don't rush.

### Is it normal for my ankle to feel stiff?

Yes, this is completely normal. Your ankle has been immobilised, and stiffness is expected. Do NOT try to stretch it yourself. The flexibility will return naturally with time and proper physiotherapy.

### My tendon feels tight - is that bad?

No, tightness is normal and actually a good sign. It means your tendon is healing in a shortened position, which is what we want. Do NOT stretch or massage the tendon. Let it heal.

### Can I remove wedges early if I feel ready?

Absolutely not. Follow your prescribed wedge removal schedule exactly. Removing wedges early could cause your tendon to heal elongated, permanently reducing your ankle power.

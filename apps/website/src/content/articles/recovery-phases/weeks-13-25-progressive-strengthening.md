# Weeks 13-25: Progressive Recovery - Building Strength, Endurance and Confidence

You're now in the longest and arguably most important phase of your recovery. The boot is behind you, physiotherapy is underway, and your focus shifts to rebuilding the strength and function you've lost. Weeks 13-25 are about progressive strengthening, building endurance, and gradually returning to normal life. This phase requires patience, consistency, and a long-term perspective.

## Understanding This Critical Phase

### What's Happening to Your Tendon (Late Remodelling)

Your tendon is well into the remodelling phase - the longest stage of healing that continues for 12-18 months or longer.

**Biological processes underway:**

- Type III collagen continues to be replaced by stronger Type I collagen
- Collagen fibres are aligning along lines of stress and force
- The tendon is becoming progressively stiffer and stronger
- Cross-linking between collagen fibres is increasing
- The tendon is adapting to the loads you place on it

**Why loading is now important:**

- Tendons respond to stress by getting stronger (within limits)
- Too little loading = weak tendon
- Appropriate loading = progressive strengthening
- Too much loading = risk of damage

**The Goldilocks principle:** Your rehabilitation needs to find the "just right" balance of loading - challenging enough to stimulate adaptation, but not so much that you overwhelm the healing tissue.

### Why This Phase Takes So Long

Many patients are frustrated by how long recovery takes. Understanding the biology helps.

**Tendon healing is slow because:**

- Tendons have limited blood supply compared to muscles
- Collagen remodelling is inherently slow
- The tendon needs time to adapt to progressively higher loads
- Rushing causes problems (elongation, re-rupture)

**Comparison to other tissues:**

- Skin: Days to weeks
- Bone: 6-12 weeks for primary healing
- Tendon: 12-18+ months for full remodelling

**The reality:**

- Full recovery from Achilles rupture typically takes 6-12 months
- Some patients take longer
- Rushing leads to setbacks; patience leads to better outcomes

### Setting Realistic Milestones

Having clear milestones helps maintain motivation and track progress.

**Weeks 13-16:**

- Comfortable walking for 20-30 minutes
- Double-leg heel raises (20+ repetitions)
- Good balance on injured leg
- Minimal swelling after activity

**Weeks 17-20:**

- Single-leg heel raises beginning (with support initially)
- Walking 30+ minutes comfortably
- Light stationary cycling
- Stairs with normal pattern (not one step at a time)

**Weeks 21-25:**

- Single-leg heel raises (10+ repetitions)
- Consideration of light jogging (if criteria met)
- Near-normal daily activities
- Return to light sports possible (non-pivoting)

## Progressive Strengthening Exercises

### Single-Leg Heel Raises - The Gold Standard

The single-leg heel raise is THE benchmark exercise for Achilles rehabilitation.

**Why it matters:**

- Tests and builds calf and Achilles strength
- Directly relates to functional activities
- A key return-to-sport criterion (25+ repetitions)
- Measures progress objectively

**Evidence-based progression with specific targets:**

**Stage 1: Double-leg heel raises (weeks 10-14)**

- Both feet on floor
- Rise onto toes together
- 2-3 sets of 15-25 reps
- Target: 15 body weight single-leg calf raises on flat ground (end of Stage 2)

**Stage 2: Initial post-immobilization (weeks 12-18)**

- Single-leg seated isotonic and isometric calf raises
- **Target: 1.4x body weight MVIC** (seated, plantarflexion)
- **Target: 1.2x body weight** seated isotonic
- Double to single leg standing progressions
- **Goal: 15 body weight single-leg calf raises** on flat ground

**Stage 3: Single-leg capacity building (weeks 18-24)**

- Single-leg standing and seated isotonic (progressing load)
- **Target: 2x body weight** plantarflexion isometric MVIC (seated)
- Progressively introduce dorsiflexion using plates (1 inch, 1.5 inch, 2 inch)
- Sled work as approaching targets

**Stage 4: Single-leg heel raises unsupported (weeks 22+)**

- No support
- Full range of motion
- **Goal: 25+ repetitions** (key return-to-sport criterion)

**Technique:**

- Rise straight up (not rolling outward)
- Push through the big toe and ball of foot
- Full squeeze at the top
- Slow, controlled descent (3 seconds down)
- Full range of motion

[GRAPHIC: Exercise progression pyramid showing stages of heel raise progression]

### Progressive Dorsiflexion Introduction (Stage 3: Weeks 18-24)

**Important:** Instead of aggressive stretching, dorsiflexion is introduced progressively through loaded exercises.

**How it works:**

- Use plates under your toes to create gradual dorsiflexion
- Start with 10kg plate (~1 inch)
- Progress to 1.5 inch plate
- Then 2 inch plate
- Do this in both knee bent and knee straight positions
- **This replaces flexibility work** - flexibility comes naturally with loaded dorsiflexion

**Why this approach:**

- Loaded dorsiflexion is safer than passive stretching
- Strengthens the tendon while improving range
- No stretching per se - just progressive loading through range
- Flexibility returns naturally as you do these exercises

### Eccentric Calf Drops (When Safe)

Eccentric exercises (muscle lengthening under load) are particularly beneficial for tendon health.

**When to start:** Usually week 20-24+, with physiotherapist approval, after you've built good strength

**The Alfredson Protocol (modified for rupture):**

**Step 1: Double-leg eccentric drops**

1. Stand on a step with heels hanging off
2. Rise onto toes using BOTH legs
3. Shift weight to injured leg
4. Lower slowly (3-5 seconds) on injured leg only
5. Rise again using both legs
6. Repeat 10-15 times, 2 sets

**Step 2: Single-leg eccentric drops (later)**

1. Rise on injured leg
2. Lower slowly on injured leg
3. Repeat 10-15 times, 2-3 sets

**Key points:**

- Slow eccentric phase is essential
- Some discomfort is acceptable (not sharp pain)
- Progress gradually over weeks
- Very effective for tendon strength

**Warning:** This is an advanced exercise. Only begin with physiotherapist approval and instruction.

### Resistance Training Progression

Building overall lower limb strength supports your recovery.

**Exercises to incorporate:**

**Squats:**

- Start with body weight
- Progress to weighted (goblet squats, then barbell)
- Focus on controlled movement
- Ensure knees track over toes

**Lunges:**

- Forward lunges initially
- Progress to walking lunges
- Reverse lunges are often easier
- Focus on stability

**Leg press:**

- Machine-based, controlled movement
- Allows progressive loading
- Good for building overall leg strength

**Romanian deadlifts:**

- Excellent for posterior chain
- Start with light weight
- Focus on form

**Important:** These exercises complement, not replace, specific calf strengthening.

### Balance and Proprioception Work

Proprioception (body awareness) is often impaired after injury and immobilisation.

**Progressive balance exercises:**

**Level 1: Single-leg stance**

- Stand on injured leg, eyes open
- Hold for 30-60 seconds
- Use support if needed initially

**Level 2: Eyes closed**

- Same as above with eyes closed
- Much more challenging
- Hold for 30 seconds

**Level 3: Unstable surface**

- Balance on a pillow or wobble cushion
- Eyes open first, then closed
- Hold for 30 seconds

**Level 4: Dynamic balance**

- Single-leg stance with arm movements
- Single-leg stance while catching/throwing a ball
- Step-ups with pause at top

**Why this matters:**

- Reduces risk of future ankle injuries
- Improves confidence in movement
- Essential for sport return
- Helps prevent re-injury

## Building Cardio Without Risk

### Swimming and Pool Exercises

Swimming is excellent cardiovascular exercise with minimal tendon loading.

**When to start:** Once any surgical wounds are fully healed and with specialist approval

**Benefits:**

- Zero impact
- Excellent cardiovascular workout
- Resistance for strengthening
- Good for mental health

**Pool exercises:**

- Walking in the pool (water supports body weight)
- Swimming (freestyle, backstroke)
- Pool running with flotation belt
- Water-based calf raises

**Precautions:**

- Avoid push-off from wall with injured leg initially
- Breaststroke may strain the ankle - start cautiously
- Flip turns are high impact - avoid initially

### Stationary Bike Protocol

Cycling is a great low-impact option for cardio and early calf engagement.

**When to start:** Usually week 12-14

**Starting out:**

- Low resistance
- Moderate cadence (60-80 rpm)
- Start with 10-15 minutes
- Ball of foot on pedal (not heel)

**Progression:**

- Increase duration before intensity
- Gradually increase resistance
- Work up to 30+ minutes
- Can use for warm-up before exercises

**Benefits:**

- Low impact on Achilles
- Maintains cardiovascular fitness
- Gentle calf muscle activation
- Can be done at home or gym

### Elliptical Training

The elliptical provides a smooth, low-impact workout.

**When to start:** Usually week 16-20

**Getting started:**

- Low resistance
- Moderate pace
- Forward motion only (not backward initially)
- Start with 10-15 minutes

**Progression:**

- Increase duration gradually
- Add resistance as comfortable
- Can be a stepping stone to running

**Precautions:**

- Monitor for any tendon discomfort
- Stop if you experience pain
- Discuss timing with your physiotherapist

### When Walking Becomes Exercise

Don't underestimate walking as cardiovascular exercise.

**Building walking fitness:**

- Gradually increase duration and pace
- Add gentle inclines
- Walk on varied terrain (grass, gravel, hills)
- Consider walking poles for longer distances

**Walking milestones:**

- Week 13-16: 30 minutes comfortable
- Week 17-20: 45-60 minutes manageable
- Week 21-25: Longer walks (90+ minutes) possible

## The Functional Milestones You're Aiming For

### Pain-Free Walking for 30+ Minutes

This is a foundational milestone that should be achieved relatively early in this phase.

**What "pain-free" means:**

- No sharp pain during or after walking
- Mild fatigue is okay
- Some stiffness that improves as you walk is normal
- Swelling that resolves with elevation is acceptable

**If you're not there yet:**

- Reduce walking duration
- Check your footwear
- Discuss with your physiotherapist
- Be patient - some people take longer

### 25+ Single-Leg Heel Raises

This is the gold standard test for calf and Achilles function.

**The test:**

- Stand on one leg (injured side)
- Rise onto your toes as high as possible
- Lower with control
- Repeat until fatigued or form fails
- Goal: 25+ repetitions (ideally matching other leg)

**Progress tracking:**

- Week 16: May manage 5-10 with support
- Week 20: May manage 15-20
- Week 24: Aim for 25+

**If you're struggling:**

- This is normal - keep working
- Focus on progressive strengthening
- Quality matters more than quantity initially
- Some people take longer to reach this milestone

### Balance on One Leg for 30+ Seconds

Balance is often impaired and needs rebuilding.

**The test:**

- Stand on injured leg, eyes open
- Time how long you can hold without support
- Goal: 30+ seconds (ideally matching other leg)

**Progressions:**

- Eyes closed: 10-30 seconds
- Unstable surface: 20-30 seconds
- Dynamic movements: Catching a ball while balancing

### Stairs Without Hesitation

Stair climbing and descending should become smooth and confident.

**Milestones:**

- **Week 13-16:** Ascending/descending without step-to pattern
- **Week 17-20:** Smooth, reciprocal pattern (normal stair climbing)
- **Week 21-25:** Running up stairs possible (late in phase)

**Descending is harder:**

- Places eccentric load on the calf
- Often the last stair skill to normalise
- Focus on control, not speed

## Returning to Normal Life

### Work and Daily Activities

By weeks 13-25, most people can return to (or have already returned to) most daily activities.

**Desk work:**

- Should be fully possible
- Take regular breaks to move
- Elevate leg if swelling persists
- Continue exercises before/after work

**Standing/mobile jobs:**

- Gradual return to full hours
- Supportive footwear essential
- Ability to rest when needed
- Discuss any limitations with employer

**Physical jobs:**

- Phased return often advisable
- Modified duties initially
- Full return typically months 4-6+
- Depends on specific job demands

**Around the house:**

- Most household tasks possible
- Gardening (be careful with uneven ground)
- DIY projects (within reason)
- Cooking, cleaning, shopping all possible

### Driving Confidently

**Right leg injured:**

- By weeks 13-16, most people can consider driving
- Must be comfortable with normal shoe on injured foot
- Should be able to perform emergency stop safely
- Check with insurance company
- Practice in a safe area first

**Left leg injured (automatic):**

- Should already be driving if not on pain medication
- Ensure boot doesn't interfere (you shouldn't be in boot anymore)

**When you're ready:**

- No hesitation with brake or accelerator
- Full range of motion to operate pedals
- Not taking impairing medications
- Feels safe and controlled

### Household Tasks and DIY

**Generally safe activities:**

- Cooking
- Cleaning
- Light gardening
- Laundry
- Shopping
- Moderate lifting

**Be cautious with:**

- Ladders (balance may not be fully restored)
- Uneven ground (gardens, construction sites)
- Heavy lifting (proper form essential)
- Activities requiring sudden movements

### Intimacy and Relationships

This topic is rarely discussed but matters to many people.

**General guidance:**

- Intimacy is typically safe once you're mobile and comfortable
- Avoid positions that put strain on the ankle
- Communicate with your partner about limitations
- Start gently and progress as confidence grows

**Practical considerations:**

- The tendon should be stable by this phase
- Avoid explosive or high-impact movements
- Support the ankle if needed (pillows)
- If concerned, ask your physiotherapist (they've heard it before)

## Nutrition for Tendon Health

### Protein Requirements (1-1.2g per kg)

Protein is essential for tissue repair and muscle building.

**How much:**

- 1-1.2g protein per kg body weight per day
- For a 70kg person: 70-85g protein daily
- Spread throughout the day (15-25g per meal)

**Good sources:**

- Lean meat and poultry
- Fish and seafood
- Eggs
- Dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese)
- Legumes and beans
- Tofu and tempeh

### Collagen Supplementation

There's growing evidence for collagen supplementation in tendon healing.

**The research suggests:**

- 15-25g hydrolyzed collagen daily
- Take 45-60 minutes before exercise
- Combine with vitamin C (enhances absorption)
- May improve tendon repair and reduce pain

**Products:**

- Collagen peptides/powder
- Bone broth
- Gelatin

**Note:** Evidence is promising but not definitive. Discuss with your healthcare team.

### Vitamin C and Other Key Nutrients

Several nutrients support collagen synthesis and healing.

**Vitamin C:**

- Essential for collagen production
- 250-500mg daily (from food and/or supplements)
- Sources: Citrus fruits, berries, peppers, broccoli

**Other helpful nutrients:**

- **Zinc:** Meat, shellfish, nuts, seeds
- **Copper:** Shellfish, nuts, seeds, organ meats
- **Vitamin D:** Sunlight, fatty fish, fortified foods
- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseed (anti-inflammatory)

### Hydration

Proper hydration supports all aspects of healing.

**Guidelines:**

- 8-10 glasses of water daily (2-2.5 litres)
- More if exercising or in hot weather
- Limit caffeine and alcohol (can be dehydrating)
- Monitor urine colour (pale yellow = well hydrated)

## Common Setbacks and How to Handle Them

### Progress Plateaus

It's common to feel like progress stalls during this long phase.

**Why plateaus happen:**

- The body adapts to current training loads
- Psychological fatigue can make progress feel slower
- Objective gains continue even when you don't "feel" them
- Comparison to pre-injury can be discouraging

**How to break through:**

- Discuss with your physiotherapist - they may adjust your programme
- Track objective measures (reps, distance, time)
- Celebrate small wins
- Remember that plateaus are temporary

### Flare-ups and What They Mean

Occasional increases in pain or swelling can occur.

**Common causes:**

- Doing too much too soon
- Increasing intensity too quickly
- New or different activities
- Weather changes (some people notice this)
- Natural fluctuations in healing

**How to respond:**

- Reduce activity for a few days (don't stop completely)
- Ice and elevate
- Return to previous activity level once settled
- Progress more gradually
- If persistent, consult your physiotherapist

**What's NOT a normal flare-up:**

- Sharp, sudden pain (especially with a "pop")
- Inability to bear weight
- Significant new swelling
- Pain that doesn't settle within a few days

### Mental Health and Kinesiophobia (Fear of Re-Injury)

Psychological recovery is as important as physical recovery.

**Common experiences:**

- Fear of re-rupture (kinesiophobia)
- Frustration with slow progress
- Anxiety about returning to activities
- Low mood or depression
- Hypervigilance about the tendon

**Strategies:**

- Acknowledge your feelings as normal
- Gradual exposure to feared activities
- Focus on what you CAN do, not what you can't
- Connect with others who've had similar injuries
- Consider professional support if struggling

**The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia** is a validated tool your physio might use to assess fear of re-injury. High scores may indicate you need additional support.

**Professional help:**

- Sports psychologist
- Counsellor or therapist
- GP if mood symptoms are significant
- Support groups (online or in-person)

## FAQs for Weeks 13-25

### When can I start running?

Running begins when you're **approaching Stage 3 targets** (not based on time alone). This is typically around weeks 18-24, but depends on meeting criteria:

**Criteria to start running:**

- Approaching 2x body weight plantarflexion isometric MVIC
- 15+ single-leg heel raises (working towards 25+)
- Good balance and proprioception
- Minimal or no pain with walking
- Physiotherapist approval

**Running progression:**

- Start with **very slow shuffle** on flat ground (not AlterG)
- **2-3 times per week** on usual training days
- Training block: Isometric work → Run → Plyometric prep before run
- **Build volume first**, then intensity later
- Once approaching Stage 4 targets (more force, more strength), progress intensity

**Important:** Running too early risks tendon elongation. The tendon needs to be strong enough to handle running forces (up to 3.2x body weight). Don't rush this - meeting strength criteria matters more than the calendar.

### Why is my calf still so much smaller than the other side?

Calf muscle asymmetry is normal and expected. The affected calf may take 12-18+ months to approach the size of the other side. Some permanent difference is possible. Continue your exercises and be patient.

### Is it normal to still have some swelling?

Mild swelling that fluctuates with activity can persist for 6-12 months or longer. It typically continues to improve gradually. If swelling is worsening or doesn't respond to elevation, discuss with your medical team.

### Can I play recreational sports yet?

Low-impact, non-pivoting sports may be possible in the later part of this phase (weeks 20-25):

- Cycling
- Swimming
- Golf (with caution)
- Gentle hiking

High-impact or pivoting sports typically wait until month 6+ with specific criteria met.

### My tendon looks thicker than the other side - will this go away?

No, and this is normal. Healed Achilles tendons are typically thicker than the original, sometimes significantly so. This is permanent but doesn't affect function. The thickening is evidence of healing.

### How do I know if I'm ready to progress to more challenging exercises?

Signs you're ready to progress:

- Current exercises feel easy (you could do more)
- No pain during or after current exercises
- Swelling is well-controlled
- You've been at current level for 1-2 weeks
- Your physiotherapist agrees

When in doubt, stay at your current level longer rather than progressing too fast.

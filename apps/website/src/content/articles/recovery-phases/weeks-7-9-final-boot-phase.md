# Weeks 7-9: The Final Boot Phase - Monitoring Progress and Preparing for Rehabilitation

You're approaching a major milestone: the end of boot-wearing. Weeks 7-9 represent the home stretch of the immobilisation phase. Your tendon is stronger now, you're likely removing your final wedges, and the prospect of proper physiotherapy is on the horizon. This guide will help you navigate this exciting but still-critical period.

## Your Tendon's Healing Progress

### The Remodelling Phase Begins

By weeks 7-9, your tendon has entered the remodelling phase - the final and longest stage of healing. This phase will continue for months to come, but it's now well underway.

**What's happening inside your tendon:**

- Type III collagen (the weaker, initial repair tissue) is gradually being replaced by Type I collagen
- Type I collagen is stronger and more organised, similar to normal tendon
- Collagen fibres are aligning along the lines of force and stress
- The number of fibroblasts and blood vessels is decreasing as the tissue matures
- The tendon is becoming progressively stronger and stiffer

[GRAPHIC: Tendon healing timeline showing transition from Type III to Type I collagen with strength curve]

**The key point:** Your tendon is significantly stronger than it was at week 2 or 4, but it's still not back to full strength. The remodelling phase continues for 12-18 months or longer. Patience remains essential.

### How Strong Is Your Tendon Now?

Understanding your tendon's approximate strength helps set expectations:

| Time Point | Approximate Strength (% of original) | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Week 2 | ~10-15% | Very fragile |
| Week 6 | ~30-40% | Stronger but still vulnerable |
| Week 9 | ~50-60% | **You are approaching here** |
| Week 12 | ~60-70% | Boot removed, early rehab |
| 6 months | ~80-90% | Return to sport consideration |
| 12 months | ~90-100% | Near full maturation |

**Important caveats:**

- These are rough estimates based on research
- Individual variation is significant
- The tendon may never be 100% identical to before
- Functional strength can be excellent even if the tendon is "different"

### Why Patience Still Matters

Even though you're feeling much better, these final boot weeks are not the time to let your guard down.

**The remaining risks:**

- The tendon can still elongate if overstretched
- Re-rupture, while less likely, is still possible
- Poor compliance now can affect your long-term outcome
- Bad habits formed now will be harder to correct later

**The good news:**

- Each day sees your tendon getting stronger
- You're approaching the end of 24/7 boot wearing
- Physiotherapy will soon give you active things to do
- The hardest part is nearly behind you

## Boot Progression to Neutral

### Removing Final Wedges

During weeks 7-9, you'll be removing your remaining wedges and approaching a neutral foot position.

**Typical progression:**

| Week | Wedges | Angle | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Week 7 | 1 wedge | ~10° | Final wedge |
| Week 8-9 | 0 wedges | Neutral (0°) | Reaching neutral |
| Week 10+ | Boot removal | - | Transition to shoes |

**How neutral position feels:**

- Your foot is now at (or close to) 90° to your shin
- Walking may feel easier and more natural
- Less strain on your hip and back
- Closer to normal footwear position

**Important:** Even at neutral, continue wearing the boot 24/7 until your specialist confirms you can begin weaning off it.

### Walking at Neutral Position

Once you reach neutral (0 wedges), your walking will feel significantly more normal.

**Changes you'll notice:**

- More natural heel-to-toe motion
- Less leg length discrepancy (though the boot still adds some height)
- Easier to walk longer distances
- Less fatigue from compensatory movements

**Walking goals for weeks 7-9:**

- Comfortable walking for 15-20+ minutes continuously
- Minimal or no use of crutches
- Even weight distribution between legs
- Confident on various surfaces (flat, carpet, gentle slopes)

**Continue using your EVENup shoe leveler** - the boot still adds height even without wedges.

### Monitoring for Warning Signs

As you approach the end of boot wearing, stay vigilant for any concerning signs:

**Warning signs to report:**

- Sudden increase in swelling
- New or increased pain (beyond mild stiffness)
- A sensation of the tendon "giving way"
- Any clicking, popping, or snapping
- Increased laxity (feeling like your ankle is loose)
- Tendon area feeling unusually soft or gapped

**What's normal:**

- Mild stiffness, especially in the morning
- Some swelling after extended walking
- Fatigue in the calf area
- Tightness that improves as you move around
- Psychological nerves about upcoming changes

## Pre-Physiotherapy Preparation

### What Physio Will Involve

Physiotherapy typically begins around weeks 9-12. Here's what to expect:

**Initial assessment:**

- Your physiotherapist will examine your ankle range of motion
- They'll assess your calf strength (or lack thereof)
- They'll check your walking pattern
- They'll discuss your goals and timeline

**Early physiotherapy goals:**

- Restore ankle range of motion (gently!)
- Begin calf muscle activation
- Improve balance and proprioception (body awareness)
- Correct any gait abnormalities
- Build towards strengthening exercises

**What physio is NOT at this stage:**

- Aggressive stretching (the tendon will loosen naturally)
- Heavy calf raises or resistance exercises
- Running, jumping, or plyometrics
- Sports-specific training

**Your role:**

- Attend all scheduled appointments
- Do prescribed home exercises consistently
- Report any pain or concerns promptly
- Be patient with the gradual progression

### Finding the Right Physiotherapist

Not all physiotherapists have specific experience with Achilles ruptures. Finding one who does can make a significant difference.

**What to look for:**

- Experience with Achilles ruptures specifically
- Sports medicine or orthopaedic focus
- Understanding of the healing timeline
- Good communication skills
- Availability that fits your schedule

**Questions to ask:**

- "How many Achilles rupture patients have you treated?"
- "What does your typical Achilles rehabilitation protocol look like?"
- "How do you approach the transition out of the boot?"
- "What are your thoughts on early stretching?" (answer should be "avoid it")

**Finding a physio:**

- Ask your orthopaedic team for recommendations
- Check with local sports medicine clinics
- Look for physiotherapists affiliated with sports teams
- Seek online reviews from Achilles patients

### Setting Realistic Expectations

Understanding the timeline ahead helps prevent frustration:

**Realistic milestones:**

- Weeks 10-12: Transition out of boot, begin physiotherapy
- Months 3-4: Building basic strength, walking normally
- Months 4-5: Progressive strengthening, possibly light jogging
- Month 6: Consideration of return to sport
- Month 12+: Full recovery for most people

**What affects your timeline:**

- Age (younger generally = faster recovery)
- Pre-injury fitness level
- Compliance with rehabilitation
- Whether you had surgery or not
- Individual healing rate
- Quality of physiotherapy

**Managing expectations:**

- Recovery is measured in months, not weeks
- Progress is rarely linear - expect some ups and downs
- Comparison to others isn't helpful - everyone is different
- Full function is the goal, even if it takes time

## Gentle Movement Exercises

### Ankle Pumps and Circles (With Boot On)

These exercises help maintain circulation and prepare your ankle for the mobility work ahead.

**Ankle pumps:**

1. Sit with your leg extended (boot on)
2. Gently flex your foot towards you, then point away
3. Move only within the range your boot allows
4. Perform 20-30 repetitions
5. Do 3-4 times daily

**Ankle circles:**

1. Sit with leg extended or foot hanging slightly
2. Draw small circles with your toes (clockwise and anticlockwise)
3. Keep movements gentle and controlled
4. 10-15 circles each direction
5. 3-4 times daily

**Important:** These exercises should NOT cause pain. If they do, stop and discuss with your medical team.

### Toe Curls and Scrunches

Maintaining the small muscles of your foot helps overall foot health.

**Toe curls:**

1. While seated (boot can be on or off if approved)
2. Curl your toes down as if picking up a marble
3. Hold for 3-5 seconds
4. Release and spread toes wide
5. Repeat 15-20 times

**Towel scrunches (if boot can be removed briefly):**

1. Place a towel flat on the floor
2. Use your toes to scrunch the towel towards you
3. Then push it away
4. Repeat until towel is fully scrunched
5. Do once daily if able

### Resistance Band Preparation

Getting comfortable with resistance bands now will help when physio starts.

**Purchasing bands:**

- Get a variety of resistances (usually colour-coded)
- Start with the lightest resistance
- Look for Theraband or similar quality brands

[PRODUCT LINK: Theraband Resistance Bands]

**Pre-physio band exercises (for non-injured leg and upper body):**

- Practice your upper body exercises with bands
- Get used to handling and anchoring the bands
- When physio starts, you'll use bands for ankle exercises

**Note:** Do NOT do resistance band ankle exercises on your injured leg until specifically prescribed by your physiotherapist.

## Practical Life at Weeks 7-9

### Returning to Work Considerations

By weeks 7-9, many people are considering or have already returned to work.

**Factors affecting work return:**

**For desk/office jobs:**

- Return possible within 2-4 weeks for many people
- Work from home may be easier initially
- Consider ergonomic setup (leg elevation, comfortable position)
- Plan for reduced productivity initially
- Build in rest breaks for walking and elevation

**For standing jobs:**

- Return typically possible by weeks 6-8 with modifications
- May need to limit standing duration
- Ensure you can sit when needed
- Consider phased return (part-time to full-time)

**For physical/manual jobs:**

- Longer wait usually required (10-12+ weeks minimum)
- Full return may not be possible until 4-6 months
- Discuss with your doctor and employer
- Phased return on modified duties often helpful

**Workplace accommodations to request:**

- Parking closer to the entrance
- Ground floor access or elevator use
- Flexible schedule for medical appointments
- Ability to elevate leg at desk
- Reduced walking requirements initially

### Driving Guidelines (Left Foot vs Right Foot Injury)

This is one of the most common questions during recovery.

**Right leg injured:**

- You CANNOT drive while wearing the boot
- Do not attempt to drive until you are out of the boot
- Most protocols suggest week 10-12 at earliest for automatic cars
- May be later for manual transmission (clutch use)
- Get clearance from your medical team
- Check with your insurance company

**Left leg injured (automatic car only):**

- Potentially possible earlier (some people by weeks 4-6)
- You must be able to control the vehicle safely
- Must not be impaired by pain medication
- The boot must not interfere with pedals
- Check with your insurance company
- Get clearance from your medical team
- Consider a short practice in a safe area first

**Important considerations:**

- Could you perform an emergency stop safely?
- Are you taking any medications that impair driving?
- Is your concentration affected by pain or fatigue?
- Does your insurance cover driving with an injury?

**When in doubt, don't drive.** The consequences of an accident far outweigh the inconvenience of not driving.

### Social Activities and Limitations

Life doesn't stop during recovery, but it does need some adaptation.

**Things you CAN do:**

- Attend social events (with appropriate seating)
- Go to restaurants (choose accessible ones)
- Visit friends and family
- Attend seated events (cinema, theatre - aisle seat)
- Low-key gatherings at home
- Many hobbies (reading, gaming, crafts, etc.)

**Things to be cautious about:**

- Crowded events where you could be jostled
- Events requiring lots of walking or standing
- Anywhere you couldn't sit if needed
- Situations where alcohol might impair your judgement (risk of falls)
- Uneven or unstable surfaces

**Practical tips:**

- Scout venues in advance for accessibility
- Arrive early to get appropriate seating
- Bring crutches "just in case" even if you don't need them for normal walking
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or accommodation
- Pace yourself - social events can be tiring

## Common Concerns

### "My Tendon Feels Too Tight" - Is This Normal?

**Yes, this is completely normal** and actually a GOOD sign.

**Why tightness is good:**

- It means your tendon has healed without excessive elongation
- The healing tissue is supposed to be tight initially
- Tightness will gradually reduce with time and proper rehabilitation
- A tight tendon is better than an elongated one

**What NOT to do:**

- Do NOT stretch your Achilles aggressively
- Do NOT try to "loosen it up" yourself
- Do NOT use passive stretching devices
- Do NOT massage directly on the tendon

**What WILL happen:**

- The tightness will gradually resolve over weeks and months
- Active exercises (like heel raises) help lengthen the tissue safely
- Normal activities progressively restore range of motion
- By 6-12 months, most people have good flexibility

**The rule:** Avoid stretching for up to a year, or as long as your physiotherapist advises. Let the tendon adapt naturally through active use.

### Swelling That Won't Go Away

Some degree of swelling is normal and may persist for months.

**Normal swelling patterns:**

- Worse at the end of the day
- Better after a night's sleep with elevation
- Increases with activity, decreases with rest
- Gradually improves over time (though slowly)

**When to be concerned:**

- Sudden increase in swelling
- Swelling accompanied by warmth, redness, or pain
- Swelling in the thigh or upper leg (could indicate DVT)
- Swelling that is significantly worse than the previous week

**Management strategies:**

- Continue elevation whenever possible
- Compression socks during the day
- Ice after prolonged activity
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid prolonged sitting or standing

**Long-term reality:** Some patients have mild swelling for 6-12 months or longer. This usually resolves but can be persistent. If concerned, discuss with your medical team.

### Mental Preparation for Boot Removal

The transition out of the boot is both exciting and anxiety-provoking.

**Common feelings:**

- Excitement at finally being "free"
- Fear about walking without protection
- Anxiety about re-injury
- Uncertainty about the future
- Impatience to be "normal" again

**Preparing mentally:**

- Recognise that some anxiety is normal
- The transition will be gradual, not sudden
- Your physiotherapist will guide the process
- You can always put the boot back on if needed initially
- Thousands of people successfully make this transition

**Reframing the transition:**

- This is the beginning of active rehabilitation, not the end
- The boot has done its job - your tendon is ready for the next phase
- Each step in shoes is a step towards full recovery
- You'll look back at this moment as a turning point

## FAQs for Weeks 7-9

### When exactly can I stop wearing the boot?

**Evidence-based protocols** recommend boot removal at **11-12 weeks** (not 8 weeks) for most people. This is based on **force-based criteria**, not just time:

- Your tendon needs to be strong enough to handle walking forces (~1.5x body weight)
- This is assessed by your ability to do seated calf raises with significant weight
- The goal is to reach 0.8-1x body weight through your knee in seated position
- This creates ~2x body weight force in the Achilles, preparing it for walking

**Traditional protocols** may remove the boot at 8 weeks, but research shows this may be too early if the tendon hasn't developed enough strength. The elongation-focused approach keeps you in the boot longer but loads you more aggressively while in it.

Wait for specific instruction from your medical team - don't self-prescribe boot removal. The timing should be based on your tendon's strength, not just the calendar.

### Can I start physiotherapy before week 9-10?

Some protocols include very gentle physiotherapy earlier. However, most structured rehabilitation programmes begin around weeks 9-12. Your specialist will guide the timing for your specific situation.

### Is it normal to feel weaker than expected?

Absolutely. Your calf muscle has had 8-9 weeks of minimal use. Significant muscle atrophy (shrinkage) is normal and expected. This is exactly what physiotherapy will address.

### Should I be worried if my tendon looks thicker than the other side?

No. A healed Achilles tendon is typically thicker than the original tendon - often significantly so. This is normal scar tissue and remodelling. It usually remains thicker permanently but this doesn't affect function.

### Can I remove the boot for physiotherapy exercises?

Only if specifically instructed by your physiotherapist and with explicit approval from your orthopaedic team. Early physio exercises can often be done with the boot on or with a night splint as protection.

### What if I can't find a physiotherapist with Achilles experience?

While Achilles-specific experience is ideal, a good general musculoskeletal or sports physiotherapist can treat you effectively by following evidence-based protocols. They may need to do some research or consult with colleagues, which is perfectly acceptable.

### My other ankle/knee/hip/back still hurts - will this improve?

Usually, yes. Once you're out of the boot and walking normally, compensatory pain from asymmetrical movement typically resolves. If it persists, your physiotherapist can address these issues as part of your overall rehabilitation.

### Is it okay to feel nervous about the next phase?

Completely normal. Moving from the protected boot phase to active rehabilitation is a significant psychological transition. Acknowledge your feelings, seek support if needed, and trust the process. Millions of people have successfully completed this journey.

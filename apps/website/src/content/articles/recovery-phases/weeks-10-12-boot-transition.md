# Weeks 10-12: Freedom from the Boot - Starting Physiotherapy and Walking in Shoes

This is the moment you've been waiting for: life without the boot. Weeks 10-12 mark a pivotal transition in your Achilles rupture recovery. You'll be learning to walk in regular shoes, starting structured physiotherapy, and beginning the active rebuilding of your calf strength. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, and absolutely crucial to get right.

## The Big Transition - Leaving Your Boot Behind

### When Is It Safe to Stop Wearing the Boot?

Boot removal timing varies by protocol and individual, but most guidelines suggest around week 10 for beginning the transition.

**Typical boot weaning protocol:**

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Day 1 | Wear shoes indoors for 1-2 hours, boot the rest of the time |
| Day 2-3 | Increase to 3-4 hours in shoes |
| Day 4-5 | Majority of the day in shoes |
| Day 6-7 | Full transition to shoes during the day |
| Night | May still use night splint for additional protection initially |

**Signs you're ready:**

- Your specialist has cleared you for boot removal
- You're at neutral (0 wedges) and comfortable
- Swelling is well-controlled
- You feel relatively confident walking in the boot

**Boot weaning is gradual** - don't throw your boot away on day one. Keep it nearby for the first week or two as a safety net.

### Your First Steps in Regular Shoes

Those first steps out of the boot are momentous - and often wobbly.

**What to expect:**

- Your ankle will feel stiff and weak
- Walking will feel strange and uncertain
- You may have a limp initially
- Your calf will fatigue quickly
- Some anxiety is completely normal

**First steps guidance:**

1. Start indoors on a flat, familiar surface
2. Have something to hold onto nearby (furniture, wall)
3. Take short, slow steps
4. Focus on heel-to-toe motion
5. Stop and rest when you feel fatigued

**Normal sensations:**

- Tightness in the Achilles area
- Weakness when pushing off
- Mild discomfort (NOT sharp pain)
- Ankle stiffness
- Calf fatigue

**NOT normal (contact your team):**

- Sharp pain
- Sensation of "giving way"
- Popping or snapping
- Significant increase in swelling
- Unable to bear weight

### Choosing the Right Footwear for Transition

Your first shoes after the boot are important. The wrong choice can cause problems.

**Ideal characteristics:**

- **Heel-to-toe drop:** 10mm or more (NOT flat shoes)
- **Heel cushioning:** Good shock absorption
- **Heel counter:** Firm support at the back of the shoe
- **Fit:** Snug but not tight, with room for heel lifts
- **Closure:** Laces preferred for adjustable fit
- **Sole:** Slightly firm, not too flexible

**Good options:**

- Running shoes (Asics, Brooks, New Balance, etc.)
- Walking shoes with good support
- Athletic trainers with cushioned heels

**Avoid:**

- Completely flat shoes (ballet flats, Converse, etc.)
- High heels (obviously)
- Flip flops or sandals
- Slip-on shoes without back support
- Minimalist/barefoot shoes
- Going barefoot

**Using heel lifts:**

- Consider adding a 0.5-1cm gel heel lift initially
- This eases the transition from the boot's heel elevation
- Gradually reduce/remove over 2-4 weeks

## Starting Physiotherapy

### What to Expect at Your First Session

Your first physiotherapy session sets the foundation for your rehabilitation.

**Initial assessment includes:**

- Discussion of your injury, treatment, and recovery so far
- Measurement of ankle range of motion
- Assessment of calf muscle strength and size
- Evaluation of your walking pattern (gait)
- Discussion of your goals and timeline

**What your physio will be looking for:**

- How much dorsiflexion (upward movement) you have
- How much plantarflexion (downward movement) you have
- Calf muscle atrophy (shrinkage) compared to the other leg
- Any compensatory movement patterns
- Your confidence and psychological readiness

**First session activities may include:**

- Teaching proper walking technique
- Introducing gentle range of motion exercises
- Beginning isometric calf exercises
- Setting up a home exercise programme
- Scheduling follow-up appointments

### Goals for Early Physiotherapy

Understanding the goals helps you stay focused and motivated.

**Weeks 10-12 physiotherapy goals:**

1. **Restore range of motion** - Gently improve ankle flexibility (especially dorsiflexion)

2. **Begin calf activation** - Wake up the atrophied calf muscles with gentle exercises

3. **Improve balance** - Rebuild proprioception (body awareness) in the ankle

4. **Normalise gait** - Correct any limping or compensatory patterns

5. **Build confidence** - Psychological recovery is part of physical recovery

**What goals are NOT for this phase:**

- Heavy calf strengthening
- Running or impact activities
- Sports-specific training
- Aggressive stretching
- Maximum range of motion

### The Importance of Consistency

Rehabilitation success depends heavily on consistent effort.

**Key principles:**

- Attend ALL scheduled physiotherapy appointments
- Complete your home exercises DAILY (or as prescribed)
- Don't skip sessions because you're "feeling fine"
- Don't overdo it because you're "feeling good"
- Follow the progression your physio sets - don't freelance

**Building a routine:**

- Same time each day for exercises
- Set reminders on your phone
- Track your exercises in a notebook or app
- Report any issues to your physio promptly

**Common mistake:** Many people reduce their exercise compliance as they start feeling better. This is when doing the exercises is MOST important. The early "easy" exercises build the foundation for harder ones later.

## The 7 Best Exercises for This Phase

These exercises form the core of early rehabilitation. Always follow your physiotherapist's specific guidance.

### 1. Towel Calf Stretch

**Purpose:** Gently improve ankle dorsiflexion (ability to pull foot up)

**How to perform:**

1. Sit on the floor with your injured leg extended straight
2. Loop a towel around the ball of your foot
3. Gently pull the towel towards you
4. Stop when you feel a MILD stretch - not pain
5. Hold for 30 seconds
6. Repeat 3-5 times

**Key points:**

- Be VERY gentle - no aggressive stretching
- You're looking for mild tension, not maximum stretch
- Only introduce this when your physio approves (usually week 10+)
- Progress slowly over weeks

**When to start:** Usually week 10-12, with physiotherapist approval

### 2. Seated Heel Raises

**Purpose:** Begin calf muscle activation without full body weight

**How to perform:**

1. Sit in a chair with feet flat on the floor
2. Slowly lift your heels off the ground
3. Squeeze your calf muscles at the top
4. Lower slowly with control
5. Repeat 15-25 times
6. Do 2-3 sets

**Progression:**

- Start with body weight only
- Add light weight on your knees as strength improves
- Increase repetitions before adding weight

**When to start:** Usually week 10+

### 3. Resistance Band Ankle Movements

**Purpose:** Build strength in all directions around the ankle

**How to perform:**

**Plantarflexion (pointing toe down):**

1. Sit with leg extended
2. Loop band around ball of foot
3. Push your foot down against the band
4. Slowly return
5. Repeat 15-20 times

**Inversion and eversion (side to side):**

1. Anchor band to one side
2. Loop around foot
3. Push foot against band resistance
4. Control return movement
5. Repeat 15-20 times each direction

**Key points:**

- Start with light resistance (usually yellow or red Theraband)
- Focus on controlled movement
- Stop if you experience pain

**When to start:** Usually week 10-12

### 4. Standing Double-Leg Heel Raises

**Purpose:** Build calf strength with both legs sharing the load

**How to perform:**

1. Stand facing a wall or counter for balance
2. Feet shoulder-width apart
3. Slowly rise onto your toes (both feet)
4. Hold at the top for 1-2 seconds
5. Lower slowly with control
6. Repeat 15-20 times
7. Do 2-3 sets

**Progression:**

1. Equal weight on both legs
2. Gradually shift more weight to injured leg
3. Eventually progress to single-leg raises (later phase)

**Key points:**

- Rise straight up, don't roll outward
- Push through the ball of the foot and big toe
- Full control on the way down
- Use support for balance as needed

**When to start:** Usually week 10-12

### 5. Gentle Balance Training

**Purpose:** Rebuild proprioception and ankle stability

**How to perform:**

**Single-leg stance (uninjured leg first):**

1. Stand near a wall for support
2. Lift your uninjured leg slightly
3. Balance on injured leg
4. Hold for 10-30 seconds
5. Repeat 5 times

**Progressions:**

- Eyes closed (later)
- Unstable surface like a pillow (much later)
- Adding arm movements (much later)

**Key points:**

- Start with support available
- Focus on quality, not duration
- Stop if you feel unstable or unsafe

**When to start:** Usually week 10-12

### 6. Walking Mechanics Training

**Purpose:** Restore normal heel-to-toe walking pattern

**How to perform:**

1. Walk slowly in front of a mirror
2. Focus on heel strike first
3. Roll through the foot smoothly
4. Push off gently with the toes
5. Equal stance time on each leg

**Key points:**

- Slow and deliberate initially
- Aim for symmetry between legs
- Gradually increase speed over days/weeks
- Pay attention to any limping

**When to start:** Immediately upon transition to shoes

### 7. Ankle Circles and Alphabet

**Purpose:** Improve mobility through full range of motion

**How to perform:**

1. Sit with leg elevated or hanging
2. Draw circles with your toes (clockwise and anticlockwise)
3. Or trace the letters of the alphabet
4. Keep the movement coming from the ankle, not the knee

**Key points:**

- Gentle, controlled movements
- Full range within comfortable limits
- Good for morning stiffness
- Can be done multiple times daily

**When to start:** Usually week 10+

## Re-Learning to Walk Properly

### The Heel-to-Toe Pattern

After weeks in a boot, your normal walking pattern needs retraining.

**Correct walking sequence:**

1. **Heel strike:** Your heel contacts the ground first
2. **Foot flat:** Weight transfers across your foot
3. **Mid-stance:** Full weight on the leg, opposite leg swinging forward
4. **Heel off:** Heel lifts as you prepare to push off
5. **Toe off:** Push off through the ball of the foot and toes
6. **Swing:** Leg swings forward for next step

**Common post-boot problems:**

- Flat-foot landing (not leading with heel)
- Reduced push-off (not using calf)
- Shortened stride length
- Uneven timing (spending less time on injured side)
- Limping or lateral trunk sway

### Correcting Limping Habits

A limp can become ingrained if not addressed early.

**Why people limp:**

- Protecting the ankle (often unconsciously)
- Genuine weakness in the calf
- Reduced range of motion
- Fear of re-injury
- Habit formed during boot wearing

**How to correct:**

1. **Awareness first:** Walk in front of a mirror or have someone video you
2. **Slow down:** Walking slowly makes it easier to control
3. **Focus on evenness:** Equal time on each foot
4. **Push through it:** Consciously push off (gently) with your injured side
5. **Physiotherapy guidance:** Your physio can help identify and correct specific issues

### Using a Mirror to Check Your Gait

Visual feedback is incredibly helpful during gait retraining.

**What to look for in the mirror:**

- Do your hips stay level?
- Is your stride length equal on both sides?
- Do you lean away from the injured side?
- Are you pushing off equally?
- Is your movement smooth or jerky?

**Video analysis:**

- Have someone record you walking towards and past the camera
- Review in slow motion
- Compare to a video of normal walking
- Share with your physiotherapist

## Managing Post-Boot Challenges

### Stiffness and Limited Range of Motion

Stiffness is expected and will gradually improve.

**Normal stiffness patterns:**

- Worse in the morning
- Improves as you move around
- May return after sitting for long periods
- Gradually decreases over weeks

**How to manage:**

- Gentle movement exercises in the morning
- Frequent position changes throughout the day
- Walking regularly (short distances, multiple times)
- Warm compresses if helpful (not cold)

**What NOT to do:**

- Aggressive stretching
- Forcing range of motion
- "Pushing through" significant pain
- Using stretching devices

### Swelling After Activity

Some swelling is normal when you increase activity.

**Expected swelling patterns:**

- Increases with activity
- Worse at the end of the day
- Improves with elevation overnight
- Gradually decreases over weeks

**Management:**

- Elevate after walking/exercise
- Ice if helpful (15-20 minutes)
- Compression socks during the day
- Don't increase activity too quickly

**When to be concerned:**

- Sudden, significant swelling
- Swelling with heat, redness, or pain
- Swelling in the thigh (could indicate DVT)
- Swelling that doesn't improve overnight

### The "Tight" Feeling - Don't Stretch Aggressively

**This is critically important:** Do NOT aggressively stretch your Achilles tendon.

**Why tightness is normal:**

- Your tendon has healed in a shortened position (intentionally)
- The healing tissue is naturally stiffer than the original
- Scar tissue takes time to become supple

**Why aggressive stretching is dangerous:**

- Could elongate the tendon (permanent weakness)
- Could damage healing tissue
- Does NOT speed up recovery
- Risks undoing months of careful healing

**The right approach:**

- Gentle, physiotherapist-guided stretching only
- Active exercises (like heel raises) that lengthen through movement
- Allow time - 6-12 months for full flexibility return
- "Low and slow" rather than "hard and fast"

**The rule of thumb:** If you're unsure whether a stretch is too aggressive, it probably is. Always err on the side of caution.

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid Aggressive Stretching

This cannot be emphasised enough.

**Do NOT:**

- Use stretching boards or devices
- Do "runner's stretch" against a wall (calf stretch)
- Have someone push your foot into dorsiflexion
- Force your heel down on stairs
- Try to "loosen up" the tendon yourself

**Instead:**

- Follow your physiotherapist's guidance precisely
- Allow active exercises to restore range
- Be patient - flexibility returns over months
- Trust the process

### No Running or Jumping Yet

Despite feeling better, your tendon is not ready for high-impact activity.

**Impact activities to avoid:**

- Running or jogging
- Jumping or hopping
- Skipping
- Sports with directional changes
- Trampolining
- High-impact aerobics

**Why:**

- Your tendon handles forces up to 11x body weight during running
- At 10-12 weeks, you have approximately 60-70% of normal strength
- Loading too soon risks re-rupture or elongation
- These activities come later (usually month 4-6+)

### Don't Overdo Walking Distance

Enthusiasm can lead to overdoing it.

**Signs you've walked too far:**

- Significant swelling that doesn't resolve with elevation
- Increased pain lasting more than 24 hours
- Limping returning after it had improved
- Excessive fatigue in the calf

**Building walking tolerance:**

- Start with 10-15 minute walks
- Add 5 minutes every few days
- Take rest days when needed
- Quality over quantity

## FAQs for Weeks 10-12

### How quickly will my strength return?

Strength returns gradually over months. By week 12, you'll have begun to rebuild, but significant improvement takes 3-6 months. Full strength may take a year. Be patient and consistent with exercises.

### Is it normal that my calf is much smaller than the other side?

Yes, this is completely expected. Your calf muscle has atrophied (shrunk) from weeks of disuse. The difference can be quite noticeable. It will rebuild with rehabilitation, though some difference may persist long-term.

### When can I stop using heel lifts?

Typically, heel lifts are used for 2-4 weeks after boot removal and then gradually reduced. Your physiotherapist will guide this transition based on your comfort and range of motion.

### My ankle cracks/pops when I move it - is this concerning?

Clicking or popping without pain is usually harmless and common as the ankle regains mobility. However, if cracking/popping is accompanied by pain, swelling, or a sensation of instability, report it to your medical team.

### Can I do calf raises every day?

In the early phase, daily gentle exercises are fine. As you progress to more challenging exercises, your physio may recommend rest days between strengthening sessions. Follow their guidance.

### How do I know if I'm doing too much?

**Warning signs:**

- Pain during or after exercise that lasts more than an hour
- Swelling that doesn't resolve overnight
- Decreased range of motion or increased stiffness
- Feeling like you're regressing

**Listen to your body** and communicate with your physiotherapist about any concerns.

### Is it okay to walk barefoot at home?

Initially, no. Supportive shoes are recommended even at home during the transition period. After 2-4 weeks of successful shoe-wearing, short periods of barefoot walking can be gradually introduced.

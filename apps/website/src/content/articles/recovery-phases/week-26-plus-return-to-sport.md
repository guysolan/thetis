# Week 26 and Beyond: Returning to Sport, Full Activity and Life After Your Achilles Rupture

Congratulations - you've reached the 6-month mark. This is a significant milestone in Achilles rupture recovery, and for many people, it represents the beginning of return to sport and full activity. But as you'll learn in this guide, recovery isn't "done" at 6 months. This phase is about safely returning to the activities you love while protecting your investment in healing.

## The 6-Month Milestone - What It Really Means

### Your Tendon at 6 Months

At 6 months post-injury, your tendon has made remarkable progress, but the remodelling process continues.

**Where your tendon is now:**

- Approximately 80-90% of ultimate tensile strength
- Type I collagen predominates (the strong, organised type)
- Collagen fibres are well-aligned along stress lines
- Tendon stiffness is approaching normal
- Still undergoing ongoing remodelling

**What this means:**

- Your tendon can handle significant loads
- Return to sport becomes possible
- But maximum strength isn't reached yet
- Continued care and progressive loading remain important

### Why Recovery Isn't "Done" Yet

Many patients expect to be "finished" at 6 months. The reality is more nuanced.

**Ongoing processes:**

- Tendon remodelling continues for 12-18+ months
- Calf muscle continues to strengthen
- Proprioception continues to improve
- Mental confidence takes time to rebuild

**The typical timeline:**

- 6 months: Return to sport consideration begins
- 9 months: Most recreational athletes can return fully
- 12 months: Most professional athletes return
- 12-24 months: Final tendon maturation

**Important perspective:** Just because you CAN return to sport at 6 months doesn't mean you MUST. Taking longer is completely acceptable if you don't feel ready.

### The Year-Long Journey to Full Strength

Full recovery from Achilles rupture is measured in months and years, not weeks.

**Typical strength recovery trajectory:**

| Time Point | Approximate Strength | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------|
| 3 months | 60-70% | Boot just removed |
| 6 months | 80-90% | Return to sport consideration |
| 9 months | 90-95% | Most recreational sport return |
| 12 months | 95-100% | Near full recovery |
| 18-24 months | 100%+ | Full maturation |

**Calf muscle recovery:**

- At 6 months, most people still have noticeable calf asymmetry
- Full calf muscle recovery can take 12-18 months
- Some permanent difference may persist (usually small)

## Return-to-Sport Criteria

### The Tests You Need to Pass

Return to sport should be criteria-based, not time-based alone. These are the key benchmarks.

**Strength tests:**

1. **Single-leg heel raises:**
   - 25+ repetitions on injured side
   - Ideally matching the uninjured side (>90% limb symmetry)
   - Full range of motion, good quality

2. **Isokinetic strength (if tested):**
   - >90% limb symmetry
   - Often done with specialised equipment

3. **Isometric strength:**
   - Ability to support 2.5-3.0x body weight in calf contraction

**Hop and jump tests:**

4. **Single-leg hop for distance:**
   - <10% asymmetry compared to uninjured side

5. **Triple hop test:**
   - <20% asymmetry

6. **Vertical jump:**
   - Approaching symmetry

**Functional tests:**

7. **Pain-free jogging:**
   - 10+ minutes continuous, pain-free

8. **Sport-specific movements:**
   - Cutting, pivoting, sprinting (depending on sport)

**Psychological readiness:**

9. **Confidence:**
   - Feeling ready to return
   - Low scores on kinesiophobia scales (fear of re-injury)

[GRAPHIC: Return-to-sport checklist diagram with visual representations of each test]

### Psychological Readiness

Physical readiness alone isn't enough - you need to be mentally ready too.

**Signs of psychological readiness:**

- Confidence in your tendon's ability to handle load
- Willingness to push yourself appropriately
- Ability to distinguish normal sensations from warning signs
- Acceptance of some residual risk

**Signs you may not be ready:**

- Significant fear of movement or re-injury
- Avoiding activities you're physically capable of
- Hypervigilance about every sensation
- Anxiety that interferes with performance

**Addressing psychological barriers:**

- Gradual exposure to challenging activities
- Working with a sports psychologist if needed
- Talking to others who've successfully returned
- Celebrating progress and building confidence step by step

### Working with Your Physio on Sport-Specific Goals

Your physiotherapist should help tailor your return-to-sport programme.

**Sport-specific considerations:**

**Running-based sports (football, rugby, basketball):**

- Emphasis on sprinting and deceleration
- Cutting and change of direction work
- Plyometric preparation

**Racket sports (tennis, squash, badminton):**

- Lateral movements
- Quick starts and stops
- Lunging mechanics

**Court sports (volleyball, basketball):**

- Jumping and landing
- Plyometric progression
- Reactive movements

**Individual sports (running, cycling, swimming):**

- Sport-specific endurance
- Technique refinement
- Gradual volume progression

## Starting to Run Again

### The Walk-Jog Progression

Running should be reintroduced gradually using a structured walk-jog programme.

**Prerequisites for starting to run:**

- 25+ single-leg heel raises
- Pain-free walking for 30+ minutes
- Good balance and proprioception
- Physiotherapist approval
- Completed pre-running plyometric preparation

**Sample walk-jog programme:**

**Week 1:**

- Walk 4 min, jog 1 min
- Repeat 5 times (25 min total)
- 3 sessions this week

**Week 2:**

- Walk 3 min, jog 2 min
- Repeat 5 times (25 min total)
- 3 sessions this week

**Week 3:**

- Walk 2 min, jog 3 min
- Repeat 5 times (25 min total)
- 3 sessions this week

**Week 4:**

- Walk 1 min, jog 4 min
- Repeat 5 times (25 min total)
- 3 sessions this week

**Week 5:**

- Continuous jogging 15-20 min
- 3 sessions this week

**Week 6+:**

- Gradually increase duration
- Then add speed work later

**Rules for progression:**

- Pain should be 0-2/10 during and after
- Next-day soreness should resolve within 24 hours
- If symptoms increase, step back to previous week
- Don't run on consecutive days initially

### Proper Running Technique Post-ATR

Good running form protects your tendon and optimises performance.

**Key technique points:**

**Cadence:**

- Aim for 170-180 steps per minute
- Higher cadence = shorter steps = less impact per step
- Use a metronome app if helpful

**Foot strike:**

- Midfoot landing is generally recommended
- Avoid heavy heel striking
- Don't over-stride (landing ahead of your body)

**Posture:**

- Slight forward lean from the ankles (not waist)
- Relaxed shoulders
- Core engaged
- Head up, looking ahead

**Arm swing:**

- Natural, relaxed arm movement
- Arms drive forward, not across body

**Consider:**

- Running gait analysis with your physio
- Video analysis to identify issues
- Gradual technique changes (not all at once)

### Surface Selection and Footwear

Where you run and what you wear matters.

**Surface progression:**

1. Treadmill (consistent, slightly cushioned)
2. Flat track or path (predictable, firm)
3. Road (harder surface)
4. Trail (uneven, more challenging)

**Avoid initially:**

- Hills (especially downhill)
- Cambered surfaces (sloped roads)
- Uneven terrain
- Sand or soft surfaces (high tendon load)

**Footwear considerations:**

- Well-cushioned running shoes
- Appropriate for your foot type
- Not overly worn (replace regularly)
- Consider professional fitting
- May benefit from mild heel raise initially

### Avoiding the "Too Much Too Soon" Trap

This is where many returning runners get into trouble.

**The 10% rule:**

- Increase weekly running volume by no more than 10%
- This applies to both distance and intensity
- If week 1 = 10km total, week 2 = max 11km

**Warning signs you're doing too much:**

- Increasing pain during runs
- Next-day soreness lasting >24 hours
- Swelling that doesn't resolve
- Stiffness getting worse rather than better
- Performance declining

**If you experience warning signs:**

- Reduce volume by 50% for a week
- If symptoms persist, stop running and consult physio
- Progress more slowly on return

---

## Plyometric Training and Jumping

### When to Start Plyometrics

Plyometric exercises (jumping, hopping, bounding) are essential for return to most sports but must be introduced carefully.

**Prerequisites:**

- 25+ single-leg heel raises
- Successfully completed walk-jog programme
- Pain-free with current activities
- Passed basic hop test
- Physiotherapist approval

**Why plyometrics matter:**

- Tendons experience forces up to 11x body weight during running
- Up to 15x body weight during gymnastics/jumping
- Your tendon must be prepared for these forces
- Plyometrics train the stretch-shortening cycle

### Progression from Pogo Jumps to Sport-Specific

Plyometric progression should be systematic and gradual.

**Level 1: Low-amplitude double-leg (weeks 1-2)**

- Double-leg pogo jumps (small, bouncy jumps)
- Double-leg jumps in place
- Box step-ups with small jump
- Focus: Low impact, build confidence
- Volume: 2 sessions/week, 40-60 contacts total

**Level 2: Higher-amplitude double-leg (weeks 3-4)**

- Larger double-leg jumps
- Squat jumps
- Box jumps (step down initially)
- Focus: Increased height and force
- Volume: 2-3 sessions/week, 60-80 contacts total

**Level 3: Single-leg introduction (weeks 5-6)**

- Single-leg pogo jumps (with support initially)
- Hop in place (injured leg)
- Split jumps
- Focus: Single-leg loading
- Volume: 2-3 sessions/week, 40-60 contacts total

**Level 4: Progressive single-leg (weeks 7-8)**

- Single-leg hops for distance
- Single-leg box jumps
- Lateral hops
- Focus: Distance and direction changes
- Volume: 2-3 sessions/week, 60-80 contacts total

**Level 5: Sport-specific (weeks 9+)**

- Bounding
- Depth jumps
- Direction changes
- Sport-specific movements
- Volume: Sport-dependent

[GRAPHIC: Plyometric progression ladder with illustrations of each exercise type]

### Managing Load and Recovery

Plyometrics are demanding - recovery is essential.

**Guidelines:**

- 48-72 hours between plyometric sessions
- Don't do plyometrics on consecutive days
- Monitor for next-day soreness
- Quality over quantity
- Stop if pain increases

**Integration with other training:**

- Don't do heavy leg strength and plyo on same day
- Plyometrics should be done when fresh (start of session, after warm-up)
- Adequate warm-up essential

## Preventing Re-Rupture

### The Re-Rupture Risk Window

Understanding re-rupture risk helps you stay safe.

**Key facts:**

- Re-rupture rate with modern protocols: <5%
- Risk is highest in first 12 weeks (boot phase)
- Risk decreases progressively over months
- Most re-ruptures occur with return to sport

**Risk factors for re-rupture:**

- Non-compliance with rehabilitation
- Returning to sport too early
- Older age
- Previous tendon problems
- Not meeting return-to-sport criteria
- Overloading before ready

**Reducing your risk:**

- Follow your rehabilitation protocol
- Meet objective criteria before sport return
- Progress gradually
- Listen to warning signs
- Maintain ongoing calf strengthening

### Ongoing Calf Strengthening (Forever)

Calf strengthening should continue beyond return to sport - ideally permanently.

**Why ongoing strength work matters:**

- Prevents deconditioning
- Maintains tendon health
- Reduces future injury risk
- Supports long-term function

**Maintenance programme:**

- Heel raise exercises 2-3x per week
- Can be incorporated into regular training
- Single-leg heel raises remain the gold standard
- Add resistance as strength permits

**Quote from expert:**
> "Even after completing your rehab programme, continued calf strengthening is vital to maintain your function and prevent recurrence, especially if you stay active." - Joseph Norton, PT

### Warm-Up Protocols

Proper warm-up is protective for your tendon.

**Pre-activity routine:**

1. **General warm-up (5-10 min):**
   - Light jogging or cycling
   - Get blood flowing to muscles

2. **Dynamic stretching:**
   - Leg swings
   - Walking lunges
   - High knees
   - Butt kicks

3. **Activation exercises:**
   - Heel raises
   - Single-leg balance
   - Light jumping

4. **Sport-specific prep:**
   - Gradual increase in intensity
   - Rehearse movements you'll perform

**Cold-start rule:** Never go from standing still to maximum effort. Always warm up.

### Recognizing Warning Signs

Know the signs that something might be wrong.

**Yellow flags (caution):**

- Increasing stiffness in the morning
- Mild pain that settles within hours
- Swelling after high activity
- Fatigue in the calf

**Response to yellow flags:**

- Reduce activity load
- Increase recovery time
- Monitor for improvement
- Discuss with physio if persistent

**Red flags (stop and seek help):**

- Sharp, sudden pain
- Feeling of "giving way" or "snap"
- Unable to push off on the foot
- Significant new swelling
- Unable to walk normally

**Response to red flags:**

- Stop activity immediately
- Seek medical attention
- Do not "test" the tendon
- Assume the worst until cleared

## Life After Achilles Rupture - The New Normal

### Your Tendon Will Always Be Different

Complete honesty: your healed tendon is not identical to the original.

**How it's different:**

- Thicker (often significantly)
- Contains scar tissue
- Slightly different mechanical properties
- May fatigue differently

**Does this matter?**

- For most people, functionally: NO
- The vast majority return to full activity
- Many professional athletes continue their careers
- The differences are usually structural, not functional

### Managing a Slightly Smaller Calf Muscle

Calf asymmetry is common and may persist long-term.

**Typical outcomes:**

- Most people regain 80-90%+ of calf circumference
- Complete symmetry may not be achieved
- Functional strength usually returns fully
- The difference is often cosmetic, not functional

**Maximising calf recovery:**

- Continue strengthening exercises
- Ensure adequate protein intake
- Be patient - gains continue for 12-18+ months
- Accept that some difference may be permanent

**Practical perspective:** Your calf will work fine for everything you want to do, even if it looks slightly different from the other side.

### The Thicker Tendon - What to Expect

The thickening of your healed tendon is permanent and normal.

**What you'll notice:**

- Visible thickening compared to other ankle
- Palpable difference when you feel the tendon
- May be 1.5-2x the thickness of original

**Is this a problem?**

- No - it's evidence of healing
- The thicker tendon functions well
- It doesn't indicate ongoing issues
- Many athletes with thick tendons perform at elite level

### Long-Term Footwear Considerations

Your footwear choices may need ongoing attention.

**Recommendations:**

- Continue wearing supportive shoes for exercise
- May benefit from mild heel lift for some activities
- Avoid completely flat shoes for long periods
- Replace worn shoes regularly
- Consider orthotics if recommended

**Going barefoot:**

- Gradually build up barefoot time
- Start with short periods indoors
- Listen to your body
- Some barefoot time is fine for most people

## When Things Don't Go to Plan

### What If I'm Not Progressing?

Some people progress slower than expected. This doesn't mean you won't get there.

**Reasons for slower progress:**

- Older age
- Other health conditions
- Surgical complications (if you had surgery)
- Poor compliance with rehabilitation
- Individual variation in healing rate

**What to do:**

- Discuss concerns with your physiotherapist and surgeon
- Review your rehabilitation programme
- Check compliance (be honest)
- Consider second opinion if appropriate
- Be patient - some people just take longer

### Tendon Elongation - Signs and Impact

Tendon elongation (healing in a lengthened position) affects some patients.

**Signs of significant elongation:**

- Unable to achieve full single-leg heel raise height
- Reduced push-off power
- Feeling of "weakness" in the ankle
- Comparison to other side shows difference

**Impact:**

- Reduced ankle power (can't rise as high on toes)
- May affect jumping ability
- Usually doesn't prevent return to activity
- May limit very high-level athletic performance

**Management:**

- Continue strengthening (improves function even with elongation)
- Accept some limitation may be permanent
- Surgical options exist for severe cases (rare)
- Most people with mild elongation function well

### When to Seek Further Medical Opinion

Sometimes additional medical input is needed.

**Seek further opinion if:**

- Not progressing despite good compliance
- Persistent or worsening pain
- Symptoms that don't match expected pattern
- Concerns about tendon integrity
- Significant functional limitations
- You're not satisfied with current progress

**Who to see:**

- Your original surgeon
- Another orthopaedic specialist (for second opinion)
- Sports medicine physician
- Specialist Achilles physiotherapist

## FAQs for Week 26+

### Will I ever be "100% recovered"?

Functionally, yes - most people return to full activity. Structurally, your tendon will always be different (thicker, contains scar tissue). But this rarely affects what you can do.

### Can I return to the sport that caused my injury?

Usually, yes. Most people successfully return to the sport where they were injured. The key is meeting all return-to-sport criteria and progressing gradually.

### Is there a higher risk of rupturing the OTHER Achilles?

There is a slightly elevated risk of injury to the other side, possibly due to compensatory stress during recovery. Maintain bilateral calf strength and be aware of this risk.

### Should I wear a brace when I return to sport?

Not typically necessary. Braces or supports may provide psychological comfort but aren't required for tendon protection at this stage. Discuss with your physio if you're considering one.

### What if I want to do extreme sports (rock climbing, martial arts, etc.)?

These are possible but require discussion with your medical team. You may need extended rehabilitation and should ensure you meet all criteria before attempting. Start with modified versions and progress.

### Will I need surgery if I have a non-surgical re-rupture?

Not necessarily. Re-ruptures can sometimes be managed non-surgically, though surgery is more commonly recommended. Each case is assessed individually.

### How long before I can compete in races or matches?

Recreational competition: Usually 6-9 months
Competitive amateur: Usually 9-12 months
Professional level: Usually 9-12+ months

These are guidelines - your timeline should be based on criteria, not calendar.

### Can I prevent an Achilles rupture in the future?

While you can't eliminate risk, you can reduce it:

- Ongoing calf strengthening
- Proper warm-up before activity
- Gradual training progression
- Adequate recovery between sessions
- Appropriate footwear
- Addressing any biomechanical issues

## Final Thoughts

Recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture is one of the most challenging journeys in orthopaedic rehabilitation. You've navigated weeks of immobilisation, months of physiotherapy, and the psychological challenge of rebuilding trust in your body.

If you've made it to week 26 and beyond, you've demonstrated the patience, consistency, and determination that leads to successful outcomes. The vast majority of Achilles rupture patients return to full activity and sport. Many say the experience, while difficult, gave them a new appreciation for their physical capabilities.

Your tendon is different now - thicker, healed, adapted. But it's strong. It's ready to support you in the activities you love. Trust your rehabilitation, continue your strengthening, and enjoy the return to everything you missed.

Welcome back.

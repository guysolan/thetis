## Achilles Tendon Rupture Treatment: Key Takeaways

A landmark UK study has found that using a removable functional brace is just as effective as traditional plaster casting for treating Achilles tendon ruptures without surgery. This finding could change how this common injury is treated worldwide.

### Functional Brace vs. Plaster Cast: What Patients Need to Know

- **Earlier Mobility:** Patients using functional braces can often begin walking sooner than those in plaster casts.
- **Similar Recovery:** The final outcome at 9 months is the same whether you use a brace or a cast.
- **Cost-Effective:** Functional bracing is often more cost-effective.
- **Safe Option:** The risk of re-rupture is similar between both treatments (around 5-6%).
- **Quality of Life:** Earlier mobility may mean less disruption to your daily life.

## For Doctors: Choosing Between Functional Braces and Plaster Casts

- **Treatment Choice:** You can confidently offer functional bracing as a viable alternative to plaster casting.
- **Safety Assurance:** The study found no increased risk of complications with functional bracing.
- **Cost Benefits:** Healthcare systems may see cost savings with functional bracing.
- **Early Advantages:** Patients often show better early outcomes (around 8 weeks) with functional bracing.
- **Long-term Results:** Both treatments achieve similar results by 9 months.

## The Research in Detail

The UKSTAR trial<sup>[1]</sup>, involving 540 patients across 39 UK hospitals, compared traditional plaster casting to functional bracing for non-surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures. This represents the largest study of its kind to date.

### Key Findings of the UKSTAR Trial

- **Duration:** 9-month follow-up period.
- **Participants:** 540 patients (79% male, average age 48.7 years).
- **Key Finding:** No significant difference in overall outcomes at 9 months between the two treatments.
- **Complication Rates:** Similar complication rates between both groups.
- **Early Benefits:** Functional bracing showed some advantages at 8 weeks.

## Study Details

- **Size:** 540 patients across 39 UK hospitals.
- **Patient Demographics:**
  - Average age: 48.7 years
  - 79% male participants
  - 70% injured during sports activities
- **Follow-up Period:** 9 months.
- **Treatment Duration:** 8 weeks in either cast or brace.

### Cost Analysis: Functional Brace vs. Plaster Cast

- Functional bracing was more cost-effective overall.
- Direct intervention costs:
  - Plaster cast: £36
  - Functional brace: £109
- Total healthcare costs over 9 months:
  - Plaster cast: £1181
  - Functional brace: £1078
- Mean cost savings with brace: £103 per patient

## Practical Implications of the Study

### For Healthcare Providers

- Consider offering functional bracing as a first-line treatment option for Achilles tendon ruptures.
- Functional braces allow immediate weight-bearing.
- They have a similar safety profile to traditional casting.
- There is potential for reduced healthcare costs.
- May improve patient satisfaction due to earlier mobility.

### For Patients

- You have the option to choose between two equally effective treatments for your Achilles tendon rupture.
- There's a possibility of earlier return to normal walking with a functional brace.
- Similar long-term recovery outcomes are expected with both treatments.
- Both options have a comparable safety profile.
- There's potential for easier daily activities with a removable brace.

## Research Context: Previous Studies on Achilles Tendon Treatment

This study represents the largest trial to date comparing functional bracing versus plaster casting for non-surgical Achilles tendon rupture treatment. Prior to this research, evidence was limited to small single-center studies with inconclusive findings.<sup>[26, 27, 28]</sup>

## Conclusion: Functional Braces Offer a Viable Alternative

This research provides strong evidence that functional bracing is a safe, effective, and potentially more convenient alternative to traditional plaster casting for non-surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures. The choice between treatments can now be based on patient preference and practical considerations, as both methods achieve similar outcomes.

## Implications for the Orthopedic Industry

The findings of the UKSTAR trial have significant implications for companies that manufacture and distribute orthopedic devices, particularly functional braces (walking boots) for Achilles tendon rupture treatment.

### Impact on Major Brands

Major brands in the functional brace market, such as **DJO Global (Aircast)**, **Össur**, **Breg**, and **VACOped**, may see increased demand for their products. These companies should consider:

- **Highlighting the research:**  Marketing materials should emphasize the UKSTAR trial results, demonstrating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of functional braces.
- **Collaboration with healthcare providers:** Partnering with hospitals and clinics to offer training and resources on functional bracing protocols.
- **Product Development**: Consider the role of adjunct products in the recovery process.
  - Night splints, like the [Thetis Medical Night Splint](https://www.thetismedical.com/night-splint/), can help maintain plantar-flexion during sleep.
  - Heel wedges can be gradually reduced to ease the tendon back to its normal length.
  - Shoe balancers, like the Evenup, can help to equalize leg length discrepancy caused by the boot.

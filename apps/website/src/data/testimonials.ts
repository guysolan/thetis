          'Ruptured Achilles is hard. And recovery is very long. I\'ve never had "total bed rest" before. This night brace as been a savior: I can sleep and rest comfortably. It is light, cool and easy to put on. Far preferable to (not) sleeping in The Boot. Sleep is critical to recovery. It\'s not cheap, but worth the price for a well designed niche medical product. Other reviewers have some negative comments about design and comfort. I don\'t agree. Strapping a sensitive injured foot into a brace is not a usual thing and some minor strap adjustments relieved discomfort. I did consult with my Orthopedic Surgeon, as Thetis recommended. Since my surgeon also has an MA in engineering, after the caveats about not "touching down", gave approval. 2 weeks post surgery I\'ve combined the Thetis night brace with the IWalk Hands Free crutch around the house. I can cook, clean, carry stuff in both hands and be a little less of an imposition on my spouse. Still use The Boot when I have to "gimp out" to run unavoidable errands. Prior to this injury I was very active, with decent balance and leg strength. All necessary for the above combination. Finally: be patient. Recovery from an Achilles Rupture takes time.',

I personally wouldn't recommend using this until a wedge has come out of your boot. I think you'll need more support than this product can offer right after surgery. But I think switching over to this nighttime brace about halfway through the boot recovery time felt pretty safe and comfortable. I wear a sock with it for comfort.

          "If you've ruptured your Achilles tendon... Commiserations! It's not fun. And it's not a quick recovery. You will have been given a Controlled Ankle Movement (CAM) boot and, after wearing it all day, there's no respite at night. Like me, you might find that sleeping in the boot is even harder than walking in it. It's hot. Things you don't notice during the day suddenly become impossible to ignore: a bit of pressure here, a bit of rubbing there. And you can't sleep. This is exactly what the night splint is designed to solve. And it works. As others have noted, the splint is not cheap, but it's a niche product, made by a small company, and there's little scope for economies of scale. You're paying for the expertise that went into its design too. In my view, it's worth every penny. It took me a bit of fiddling around making minor adjustments to the position and tightness of the straps to get it comfortable. It's a case of balancing security and comfort. I prioritised security and, the first night, I had tightened the strap that goes under the foot a little too much and, as a result, the splint was pressing on the top of my foot too much for a whole night's comfort. I was also concerned that the strap at the heel might cause problems, but it hasn't. In the end, I've found that I'm actually having the heel strap a little tighter than the calf and foot straps and that's got the balance between security and comfort about right. I've still found that a cotton wool make-up pad, half under the splint, at the edge nearest my small, outer toes helps: everyone's feet are different and I found that was a bit of a pressure point. However, it's worth the effort: I've been able to sleep well and the splint has remained secure. The recovery of my Achilles tendon remains on track too. In summary, then, this has been a very worthwhile order. It's a good example of a small company that's identified a problem and provided a solution. (Note: the Thetis website is also an excellent source of information about Achilles tendon injuries and recovery.) I would also suggest searching for the Evenup Shoe Balancer on Amazon: another helpful product but one that makes walking with a CAM boot a bit easier.",

          "I read the reviews for the night splint but nn one said much about foot size or leg length. As I am a size 3.5 (36) UK size feet and only 5 feet tall (short legs) I was rather undecided whether the small would fit as it is advertised smaller than a size 8 which is a lot bigger than I am. As you will see from the photo it fits perfectly and keeps my ruptured Achilles in place while I sleep. This is a great step forward (sorry about the pun) as although I had found a way of sleeping with my boot on, this works much better. It's lighter for a start and keeps my foot supported at the right angle. The splint sits in place with the straps done up and they don't need to be too tight to keep it secure. I wear an ankle support under it as my foot gets cold and this also seems to help keep it secure. I'm not sure about the size 8 cut off for sizing though, as I think someone with a longer leg, and bigger foot than me might need the large to get the ankle strap in the right place. You must not use the splint to weight-bear so I only use it for sleeping or resting. As a doctor and psychologist I've found my ruptured Achilles incredibly frustrating so having the splint offers a bit of comfort in miserable circumstances. The price reflects the special nature of the product, though I recognise that not everyone is as fortunate as I am and maybe totally reliant on NHS-provided aids. I found the splint through the Achilles rupture e book by Matthew Solan and if you are looking for good info on this injury the e book is definitely worth a read. If you are reading this because like me you have ruptured your Achilles I empathise and wish you well with your recovery. Please do follow your doctor's instructions to get it soonest mended.",

          "I ruptured my achilles and spent 3 weeks \"In the boot\" before I finally gave in with lack of sleep and started to research products like this. I was swayed by the positive reviews on this product and took the plunge, it has genuinely been the single best decision I have made in my recovery so far, its light, easy to fit and comfortable (as long as you don't overtighten the straps). My physio has said this is fine to use when resting/sleeping but obviously not for weight bearing (which is stated *in bold*, in the instructions). If you're struggling to sleep in your heavy achilles boot and your significant other is fed up of being knocked and poked by the cumbersome boot then I'd definitely recommend purchasing one of these.",

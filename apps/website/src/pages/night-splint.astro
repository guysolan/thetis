                    "I recently began using the Thetis Night Splint overnight.
                    My regular boot is good for daily use but very heavy and
                    uncomfortable to sleep in - the night splint has been
                    revolutionary for me! It keeps my foot perfectly in place
                    but without being bulky, meaning I can sleep more
                    comfortably with no fear of hurting my Achilles tendon. I
                    would highly recommend everyone and anyone to use this
                    product during your recovery from Achilles rupture."

                    "The Thetis Night Splint is a lot slimmer and far more
                    lightweight than the orthopaedic boot I was sleeping in. It
                    allows me to move my leg more freely but still stops me from
                    flexing my toes beyond a certain point, which is ideal
                    whilst the tendon heals. The splint even comes in my
                    favourite colour, so I was sold the minute I saw it!"

                    "When I tore my own Achilles tendon, the hardest part of the
                    recovery was having to wear the hospital boot in bed at
                    night for many weeks. My only option was to make myself a
                    splint using plaster-cast materials and make-shift straps.
                    It is fantastic that Thetis Medical have produced this
                    night-splint. It is certain to improve the recovery
                    experience for patients."

                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h4>Can you use the splint for Achilles tendonitis?</h4>
                    <p>
                        No, the splint is only used after rupture of the
                        Achilles tendon. It is not suitable for broken bones,
                        plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendonitis. The splint
                        holds the foot pointed downwards, in a tip toe position,
                        for tendon healing. For other conditions, like plantar
                        fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis, there are different
                        splints deliberately designed to do the opposite, and
                        hold the foot up.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="space-y-2">
                    <h4>Can you use the splint instead of a boot?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, it is designed as an alternative - but ONLY for use
                        when resting. You cannot walk or stand in the splint
                        without crutches.

                    <h4>Is the sizing accurate?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, the sizing is accurate. Sizing is based on foot
                        size, designed to ensure that the splint does not
                        interfere with the toes.

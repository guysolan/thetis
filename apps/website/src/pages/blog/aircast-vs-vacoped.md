When discussing the Aircast, we are referring to the [AIRSELECT ELITE](https://www.djoglobal.com/products/aircast/airselect-elite). The Aircast boot is a type of cast that is designed to protect and immobilize the foot and ankle after an Achilles rupture. The boot has air-filled bladders that provide support and comfort while walking. The boot is designed with removable wedges that can be added or removed to adjust the angle of the foot and ankle, which can help stretch the Achilles tendon and promote healing.

### Advantages

-   Customizable: The Aircast boot is highly customizable, as the wedges can be added or removed to adjust the angle of the foot and ankle, which can help to promote healing.
-   Lightweight: The Aircast boot is relatively lightweight and easy to use, making it a popular choice for many patients.
-   Inexpensive: Compared to other treatment options for an Achilles rupture, the Aircast boot is relatively inexpensive, making it a popular choice for those who want an effective treatment option that won't break the bank.

The VACOped boot has an air-filled chamber that provides compression and helps reduce swelling. It also has a unique hinged design that allows for contrulled ankle movement, which can help promote healing and prevent muscle atrophy.

## Breakdown

The wedges inside the boot help to adjust the angle of the foot, depending on the healing stage of the Achilles tendon. The Aircast boot comes in several sizes and fits both the left and right foot.

On the other hand, the VACOped boot has a more complex design that allows for full immobilization of the foot, which is essential in the early stages of Achilles tendon rupture. The VACOped boot features a vacuum cushion, a heel wedge, and a toe wedge that can be customized to the patient's needs. It also comes with an adjustable air pump that allows for a customized fit.

## Activities

When recovering from an Achilles tear, you will still want to do all the regular things required in your daily life. Being able to walk, sleep, wash and drive are incredibly important. How easy, or difficult, the boot makes these tasks should therefore be considered. Below, the boots are compared for each criteria.

### Walking

One of the most critical aspects of the recovery process is being able to walk with the boot comfortably. The Aircast boot with wedges is lightweight and designed with an air-filled cushion that distributes pressure evenly, providing excellent comfort while walking. Unfortunately, movement in the wedge can cause problems for some patients. The VACOped boot is heavier, but it provides complete immobilization of the foot, providing additional support and stability. The bottom of the VACOped boot also features a more pronounced rocker. This changes the walking style, allowing the user to rock from heel to toe more easily. This feature gives the VACOped a narrow win.

üèÜ **Winner: VACOped.**

### Sleeping

Wearing a comfortable boot while sleeping is essential for a good night's rest. Unfortutely, the Aircast boot with wedges is bulky, making it difficult to sleep. Meanwhile the VACOped boot is slight more comfortable thanks to its vacuum cushion and adjustable air pump. Despite this, niether option is great. To get a good nights sleep, the Achilles rupture night splint can be worn at night for a lightweight, cool and slim-line solution.

### Showering and Bathing

The Aircast boot with wedges is not waterproof, but it can be covered with a plastic bag or shower sleeve, making it a practical option. The VACOped boot is waterproof, making it a clear winner in this category.

### Driving

Driving can be a challenging activity while wearing a boot, and it's essential to have one that doesn't interfere with your ability to operate the pedals. The Aircast boot with wedges is lightweight, making it easy to drive in, while the VACOped boot is bulkier and heavier, making it more difficult to drive in. Additionally, the heavy rocker which makes the boot suitable for walking, makes driving harder. In this category, the Aircast boot with wedges is the winner.

## Summary

The choice between the two largely depends on the patient's individual needs, preferences, and budget. The Aircast boot is a good choice for patients who want a customizable, lightweight, and inexpensive treatment option, while the VACOped boot is a good choice for patients who want increased mobility, increased support, and waterproofing, but are willing to pay a higher price for those benefits.

                <p>Complete recovery can take anywhere from 6 months to a year, depending on the severity of the injury, treatment method, and individual factors. This timeline provides a general guide, but your healthcare provider will give you a personalized estimate.</p>

                <p>You will likely start with non-weight-bearing activities and gradually progress to partial weight-bearing with crutches and a boot.  Walking in the boot is generally encouraged. The exact timing will be determined by your doctor and physiotherapist.</p>

                <p>
                    Most Achilles tendon ruptures are treated non-surgically.

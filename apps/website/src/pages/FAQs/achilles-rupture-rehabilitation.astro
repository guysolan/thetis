                > for simple ankle range-of-motion and seated calf activation. By
                weeks 6-10 you'll progress to resistance bands and load-bearing heel

            <h2>When is it safe to put weight on my foot?</h2>
            <p>
                Evidence supports <strong>early protected weight-bearing</strong
                > in a boot as soon as comfort permits – often within the first few
                days. This promotes tendon healing and reduces stiffness. Keep the
                foot pointed (don't let the ankle bend up) whenever you stand.

            <h2>When can I drive again?</h2>
            <p>
                For <em>right</em>-sided injuries most surgeons recommend
                waiting until you can perform an emergency stop simulation in
                trainers – typically after week 8-10 once you're out of the
                boot. Left-sided injuries in an automatic car may return sooner.
                Check with your doctor and insurer first.
            </p>

            <div id="q6"></div>
            <h2>How do I progress from walking to running?</h2>
            <p>
                Start with a <strong>jog-walk programme</strong>: 1 min jog / 1
                min walk x10 on a flat track when you can perform 25 single-leg
                heel raises pain-free. Gradually increase jog intervals and
                introduce direction changes.

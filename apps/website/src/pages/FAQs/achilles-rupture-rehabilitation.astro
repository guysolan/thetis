            <h2>Achilles rehab timeline – what happens each week?</h2>
            <p>
                Recovery usually follows a <a href="/FAQs/achilles-rupture-timeline" class="text-primary underline">week-by-week roadmap</a>:
                • Weeks 0-2: Boot in tip-toe (equinus) position, partial weight-bearing.<br/>
                • Weeks 2-6: Gradual heel-wedge reduction, full weight-bearing, begin gentle isometrics.<br/>
                • Weeks 6-10: Transition out of boot, double then single-leg heel raises.<br/>
                • Months 3-6: Running drills and sport-specific training.<br/>
                • 6+ months: Return to competition once calf strength is ≥90 % of the other side.
            </p>

            <div id="q2"></div>
            <h2>When can I start physiotherapy?</h2>
            <p>
                Most protocols introduce <strong>guided physio around week 2-3</strong> for simple ankle range-of-motion and seated calf activation. By weeks 6-10 you'll progress to resistance bands and load-bearing heel raises. For prescribed timelines see our <a href="/FAQs/what-happens-if-my-achilles-is-ruptured#q4" class="text-primary underline">physio start section</a>.
            </p>

            <div id="q3"></div>
            <h2>When is it safe to put weight on my foot?</h2>
            <p>
                Evidence supports <strong>early protected weight-bearing</strong> in a boot as soon as comfort permits – often within the first few days. This promotes tendon healing and reduces stiffness. Keep the foot pointed (don't let the ankle bend up) whenever you stand. Full details in our <a href="/FAQs/life-after-achilles-rupture#q4" class="text-primary underline">walking guide</a>.
            </p>

            <div id="q4"></div>
            <h2>Best home exercises after an Achilles rupture</h2>
            <p>
                Early phase: seated plantar-flexion squeezes, towel curls, gentle ankle circles.<br/>
                Mid phase: double-leg heel raises, Theraband resisted pushes, stationary bike.<br/>
                Late phase: single-leg heel raises (25+ reps), hopping, skipping, agility ladder.  
                Always follow the plan from your physio and stop if sharp pain occurs.
            </p>

            <h2>When can I drive again?</h2>
            <p>
                For <em>right</em>-sided injuries most surgeons recommend waiting until you can perform an emergency stop simulation in trainers – typically after week 8-10 once you're out of the boot. Left-sided injuries in an automatic car may return sooner. Check with your doctor and insurer first.
            </p>

            <div id="q6"></div>
            <h2>How do I progress from walking to running?</h2>
            <p>
                Start with a <strong>jog-walk programme</strong>: 1 min jog / 1 min walk x10 on a flat track when you can perform 25 single-leg heel raises pain-free. Gradually increase jog intervals and introduce direction changes.

            <h2>Top tips to avoid re-rupture</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wear the boot or splint <em>every</em> night for the full 10&nbsp;weeks.</li>
                <li>Remove the boot only when seated and never let the ankle bend up.</li>
                <li>Use crutches for balance until you can walk without a limp.</li>
                <li>Follow your physio's loading plan – calf strength is king.</li>
            </ul>

                question: "What is the typical Achilles rehab timeline?",
                answer: "Weeks 0-2: partial weight-bearing in a boot. Weeks 2-6: heel-wedge reduction & early physio. Weeks 6-10: out of boot, heel raises. Months 3-6: return-to-run drills. 6+ months: unrestricted sport when strength >90 %.",

            {
                question: "When can I start physiotherapy?",
                answer: "Usually around week 2-3 for gentle range-of-motion and isometrics, progressing to resistance work by week 6-10.",

                question: "How soon can I walk without crutches?",
                answer: "Many patients discard crutches between weeks 2-4 once full weight-bearing in the boot feels comfortable.",

                question: "How do I know I'm ready to run?",

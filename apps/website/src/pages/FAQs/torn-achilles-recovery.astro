            <h2>Achilles walking cast vs boot – which is better?</h2>
            <p>
                The beauty of the boots is that they can be removed (for a wash
                or to scratch an itch). Check our <a href="/FAQs/achilles-tear-treatment" class="text-primary underline">Achilles treatment options guide</a> for more on choosing the right boot.
                <br /><br />The danger of the boots is that they can
                be removed (at which point the Achilles is at risk of
                re-injury).
                <br /><br />So - boots are both good and bad!
                <br /><br />Boots are convenient and safe – as long as they are
                used properly and you don't cut corners. Misuse may lead to a
                re-rupture of the tendon, which usually requires an operation.
                Then you have to start the recovery all over again. This is
                extremely frustrating.
            </p>

            <h2>Which Achilles tendon rupture boot is best?</h2>
            <p>
                Boots come in two different designs. Both are shaped to hold
                your ankle in a tip-toes position. This brings the torn tendon
                ends together to allow healing.<br /><br />
                Wedges are used in some boots to lift the heel. As the weeks of recovery
                pass, the number of wedges (and so the height that the heel is lifted
                to) is gradually reduced. <br /><br />
                Hinges are fitted to other boots. The angle of the hinge is adjusted
                towards a flatter foot posture as recovery progresses.<br /><br
                />
                Nobody knows for certain whether one or other style is better for
                recovery. Both types of boot work very satisfactorily; as long as
                they fit well and are used properly.

            <h2>How to sleep comfortably with an Achilles rupture boot?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you DO need to maintain a tip toe position at night. You
                must either use your boot or consider a Thetis Achilles Night
                Splint. If you take the boot or splint off, then the healing
                tendon is at high risk of re-injury.<br /><br />
                Sleeping in the hot and heavy boot is the most common complaint from
                patients recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture. The specially
                designed <a id="blue-link" href="../night-splint"
                    >Achilles Rupture Splint</a
                >, from Thetis Medical solves these problems. <br /><br />
                Sleeping in the boot brings other problems. Since you are walking
                on it during the day, the bottom of the boot inevitably gets dirty.
                Some boots have a detachable sole, but this leaves sharp plastic
                edges. The Thetis Achilles Splint avoids this too. Another solution
                is to put the injured leg, inside the boot, into an old pillowcase.
                This protects the other leg from being scratched by the plastic and
                straps. It also keeps the bed clean.

            <h2>How long for an Achilles tendon rupture to heal?</h2>
            <p>
                Whether the tendon is treated with surgery, or allowed to mend
                naturally in a boot, the healing time is long. It is usual to
                spend 10 weeks in a plaster cast or boot. After this, healing is
                sufficiently advanced to allow walking without the boot, and
                physiotherapy begins. However, the tendon is not at full
                strength even then. Re-rupture is still possible. Competitive
                sport is not advised until at least six months from injury.
            </p>
            <div id="q5"></div>

            <h2>Recovery time with and without surgery?</h2>
            <p>
                There is no difference. Surgery does not make the recovery from
                a torn Achilles tendon any quicker. The goal of surgery is just
                to ensure that the two ends of the torn tendon sit close
                together, so that natural healing can occur. The stitches are
                not strong enough to support body weight. Activity without the
                protective boot or cast cannot commence until the tendon has had
                sufficient time to heal.
            </p>

            <h2>Partial Achilles tear recovery</h2>
            <p>
                The Golden Rule is that there is NO SUCH THING as a partial tear
                of the Achilles tendon. Assume you have a complete rupture of
                the tendon until a specialist has assessed your injury. (A
                partial tear can in fact occur but is extremely rare).
            </p>
            <div id="q7"></div>

            <h2>Achilles tendon recovery/rehab exercises</h2>
            <p>
                Your physiotherapist will guide you through the stages of
                recovery. The goal is to build the calf muscle strength. Lots of
                heel lifts/tip toe exercises are required, before advancing to a
                return to sport program. All this takes at least six months. It
                is important to avoid stretching exercises even if the tendon
                feels tight. With time it will always gradually stretch a
                little.

                question:
                    "What's better for Achilles recovery - walking casts or boots?",
                answer: "Boots offer both advantages and disadvantages. The main benefit is that they can be removed for washing or scratching an itch. However, this removability is also a potential risk, as improper removal or misuse can lead to re-injury. While boots are convenient and safe when used correctly, cutting corners in their use may result in re-rupture of the tendon, requiring surgery and restarting the entire recovery process.",
            },
            {
                question:
                    "Which type of Achilles rupture boot should I choose?",
                answer: "There are two main boot designs, both shaped to hold your ankle in a tip-toe position for healing: 1) Boots with wedges that lift the heel, which are gradually reduced during recovery, and 2) Boots with hinges that can be adjusted towards a flatter foot posture over time. Both types are equally effective for recovery, provided they fit well and are used properly.",
            },
            {
                question: "How should I sleep with a torn Achilles tendon?",
                answer: "It's essential to maintain a tip-toe position during sleep using either your boot or a specialized splint. Removing protection during sleep puts the healing tendon at high risk of re-injury. While sleeping in a boot can be uncomfortable and may dirty your bedding, solutions include using a detachable sole or placing the booted leg in an old pillowcase to protect both your bed and your other leg from scratches.",
            },
            {
                question: "How long does Achilles tendon healing take?",
                answer: "The healing process is lengthy, typically requiring 10 weeks in a plaster cast or boot, regardless of whether you have surgery or not. After this initial period, you can begin walking without the boot and start physiotherapy. However, the tendon isn't at full strength even then, and re-rupture is still possible. Competitive sports should be avoided for at least six months post-injury.",
            },
            {
                question: "Is recovery faster with surgery?",
                answer: "No, surgery does not accelerate recovery time. The purpose of surgery is simply to ensure proper alignment of the torn tendon ends for natural healing. The surgical stitches aren't strong enough to support body weight, and you'll still need the same protective period in a boot or cast as non-surgical treatment.",

            <h2>How to treat a torn Achilles tendon – surgery vs non-surgical?</h2>
            <p>
                Tendons, like bones, heal well in the right conditions. For the
                Achilles tendon it is thought that healing is best when the two
                torn ends are close together. Usually this is achieved by
                putting the foot into a tip toe position and keeping it there
                with a plaster cast or boot. If the ends of the tendon do not
                come together well, leaving a "gap" (this can be determined
                using an ultrasound scan) then surgery may be an option. The
                operation is to bring the ends together. It does not make the
                tendon strong. The same long recovery is required whether or not
                surgery is used. For real-world recovery examples, read our <a href="/FAQs/torn-achilles-recovery" class="text-primary underline">Torn Achilles recovery guide</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>How long can you wait for Achilles tendon surgery?</h2>
            <p>
                Most surgeons prefer to repair the tendon (when surgery is
                required) within three weeks of the injury. This is because
                after that the "elastic" tendon ends have pulled apart and are
                harder to join.
            </p>
            <div id="q3"></div>
            <h2>How long does Achilles tendon surgery take?</h2>
            <p>
                Surgery to repair the Achilles tendon is usually performed as a
                Day Surgery procedure. The operation takes less than one hour.
                The recovery and rehabilitation will take many months.
            </p>
            <div id="q4"></div>
            <h2>Recovery from Achilles Rupture Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                It takes 2 weeks for the skin stitches to heal and you will
                probably be in a plaster cast till then. Once you are supported
                in a suitable boot, with the foot held in a tip-toe posture,
                then you can (and should) walk. Crutches may still be useful, to
                help with balance. After a few weeks (4-6) the boot is adjusted
                little by little to allow the heel to come down. From ten weeks
                (approximately) the boot is no longer needed. Now the long
                process of building up the muscle and rehabilitating begins.
                This phase lasts for about 6 months.

            <h2>Pain after Achilles tendon rupture / surgery</h2>
            <p>
                The initial "snap" is painful, but this usually subsides
                quickly. The injury is then surprisingly painless. Similarly, if
                surgical repair is needed there is not much need for pain
                medication once the soreness from the skin cut settles.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <div id="q6"></div>

                <li>
                    <b>Heel Pain</b> - Once you are walking in the boot then the
                    underneath of the heel can become sore. Adding a gel heel cushion
                    from the chemist store may help. This type of pain tends to resolve
                    once you begin rehabilitation without the boot.
                </li>
                <div id="q7"></div>

                <li>
                    <b>Calf pain</b> – This should not be ignored, particularly if
                    there is swelling affecting the whole lower leg. This combination
                    of problems might mean there is a blocked vein (thrombosis),
                    which can still occur even if you are taking blood thinners to
                    prevent such problems. Seek medical advice if you are worried
                    about this.
                </li>
                <div id="q8"></div>
                <li>
                    <b>Calf Spasm</b> – A more common type of calf pain is cramping
                    from the muscle which "has nothing to pull on" due to the tendon
                    rupture. This type of pain will not have associated swelling
                    and is intermittent.
                </li>
                <div id="q9"></div>

                <li>
                    <b>Knee Pain</b> – This can occur due to the awkwardness of the
                    high heeled boot and might affect either knee.
                </li>
                <div id="q10"></div>

                <li>
                    <b>Nerve Pain</b> – nerve damage is possible with surgical repair
                    but tends to leave numbness rather than pain. Awkward walking
                    from the boot (or crutches) can rarely give rise to back trouble
                    and sciatica-like pain.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div id="q11"></div>

            <h2>Scar healing post-surgery</h2>
            <p>
                The skin scar from an Achilles tendon repair usually heals very
                well, becoming almost invisible with time. During the early
                weeks after surgery there is a risk of skin infection, so
                resting properly to begin with is important (to keep the
                swelling down and stop the wound stretching). Once the plaster
                is removed and the sutures have gone you may wish to use creams
                or ointments rich in Vitamin E. Special scar reducing adhesive
                dressings may be of benefit, especially if you are prone to
                broad or "keloid" scar formation.

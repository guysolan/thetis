            <h2>What will happen in A&E?</h2>
            <p>
                Your injury will be assessed and if an Achilles tendon rupture
                is suspected then you will be put into a tip toe position with
                (usually) a plaster cast bandaged in place. This is so that at
                the back of your leg the two ends of the torn tendon will sit
                together and can start to heal. You might be fitted with a boot
                incorporating a high heel instead. You should be given crutches
                to help you walk.
                <br /><br />Blood thinning medicine is usually advised in order
                to prevent a blocked vein (thrombosis). Arrangements are made
                for you to see a specialist for further care.
            </p>
            <div id="q2"></div>
            <h2>What will the specialist do?</h2>
            <p>
                When you are seen by the specialist, the plaster cast is removed
                to allow the injury to be re-assessed and the diagnosis
                confirmed. Occasionally the Achilles tendon is normal and a
                similar more minor injury (e.g. calf muscle tear) is found
                instead. Sometimes there is no rupture, just tendinitis of the
                Achilles.
                <br /><br />
                Often an ultrasound scan is performed. This is not to check the diagnosis,
                but is to ensure that, in the tip toe position, the two ends of the
                tendon meet. Occasionally (about 10% of the time) they do not. Blood
                or other tissue can get between the tendon ends. This situation leads
                to a discussion regarding the merits of surgery. The goal of surgery
                is to remove the debris from between the two ends of the tendon and
                stitch them together to allow healing. The repair is not strong.
                The rehabilitation is the same for surgically repaired tendons as
                it is for those managed without an operation.
                <br /><br />
                The ultrasound scan also checks that there is no thrombosis (leg
                vein blockage) in the leg. After the ultrasound scan a special boot
                with heel wedges or hinges is fitted to replace the cast. This must
                be worn for a total of 10 weeks, to allow the tendon to heal. During
                this period the tip toe posture is maintained in the boot. If you
                remove the boot and stand up, the ankle will bend upwards and the
                repairing tendon is torn again.
                <br /><br />
                Sleeping in the hot and heavy boot is the most common complaint from
                patients recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture. The specially
                designed Achilles Rupture Night Splint, from Thetis Medical (www.thetismedical.com)
                solves these problems.
                <br /><br />
                The recovery is like the game Snakes and Ladders (Shutes and Ladders)
                â€“ each week sees you closer to the finish. But one small mistake
                is like landing on the big snake that takes you right back to the
                beginning, with a re-rupture.

            <h2>How many check-ups?</h2>
            <p>
                A clinic appointment may be recommended after 5 weeks to check
                healing and give instructions for gradual adjustment of the
                boot. Referral to physio is arranged. Further scans are not
                routinely required.
                <br /><br />
                Depending upon the type of boot you are using, instructions regarding
                changing the heel wedges or adjusting the hinge are now required.
                The position of the foot is gradually adjusted until you are walking
                almost flat in your boot (week 8-10). After 10 weeks your tendon
                is sufficiently well healed to discontinue the boot and start physiotherapy.
                However, the tendon has not reached full strength yet. It is advisable
                to put the boot on if you are going anywhere crowded, where the terrain
                is unpredictable or if there is any other reason why you might stumble
                or trip. Re-rupture of the tendon at this stage in recovery is extremely
                frustrating.

            <h2>When should I see a physio?</h2>
            <p>
                Physiotherapy starts 9-10 weeks after injury. A specific rehab
                protocol is used by the physiotherapy team. Building up calf
                muscle strength is the key goal. This requires lots of exercises
                in between visits to the physiotherapist. It is important to NOT
                do vigorous stretches (even if the tendon feels a little tight)
                because the tendon can stretch out too much, resulting in long
                term loss of power in the leg. You can expect any tightness to
                gradually resolve over time and with normal activity.

            <h2>Should I take blood-thinners?</h2>
            <p>
                An Achilles rupture is a relatively high-risk injury for
                developing a blockage in the leg veins. For this reason,
                blood-thinners are often recommended. Injections or tablets can
                be used. Different hospitals have different policies in this
                regard. No-one really knows the best duration to take
                blood-thinners for. After a new hip or new knee operation
                blood-thinners are often recommended for 6 weeks and many Foot
                and Ankle Surgeons recommend this duration of preventative
                treatment for Achilles rupture patients.
                <br /><br />
                If you have not been given any blood-thinners then 150mg of Aspirin
                a day is something you could consider taking until you discuss the
                issue with your specialist.
                <br /><br />
                Remember that even with blood-thinners it is possible (though very
                rare) to develop a thrombosis/blocked vein. Swelling of the whole
                leg up to the knee should prompt medical review even if painless.

                    Surgery is not always required for Achilles Tendon Rupture

                        Patients with a ruptured Achilles tendon are often
                        surprised to hear that they do not require an operation
                        to repair it. Natural healing is, in fact, extremely
                        reliable. Treatment in a boot with “functional
                        rehabilitation” gives excellent results. Surgical
                        treatment is not required except in certain
                        circumstances. Surgery always carries more risks than
                        non-surgical treatment.

                        This scientific paper from the UK was published in 2015.
                        It remains the best evidence for how an Achilles tendon
                        rupture should be treated.

                            Newspapers and the internet frequently write about
                            using biological therapies to treat orthopaedic
                            injuries. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a treatment
                            where the patient’s own blood is taken from an arm
                            vein, spun to concentrate the healing potential and
                            injected back into the injured/painful part. This is
                            a promising idea and has been tried in many parts of
                            the body. Unfortunately there is no reliable
                            evidence that it is useful.

                            Thetis surgeons were involved with the PATH-2 study
                            investigating the use of PRP in Achilles’ tendon
                            ruptures. The results demonstrate no benefit with
                            the use of PRP. The 2 year data has recently been
                            published reinforcing the conclusion that enhancing
                            healing with PRP is not yet a reality.

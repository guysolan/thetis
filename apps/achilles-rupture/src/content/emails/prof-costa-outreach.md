Dear Professor Costa,

Your groundbreaking UKSTAR trial has transformed how we approach Achilles tendon rupture treatment. As someone who has dedicated years to helping patients recover from this debilitating injury, I've witnessed firsthand how your research is changing lives in clinical settings.

We've recently published a comprehensive article on our Thetis Medical blog highlighting the remarkable findings of your study comparing functional braces to plaster casts. I wanted to personally share it with you, as your work forms the cornerstone of this evidence-based overview:

[Achilles Tendon Rupture Treatment: Functional Braces vs. Plaster Casts](https://thetismedical.com/articles/plaster-vs-boot)

What impressed me most about the UKSTAR trial was not just its scale (540 patients across 39 UK hospitals is truly remarkable), but the methodological rigor you and your team maintained throughout. The finding that functional bracing offers comparable outcomes to casting while potentially reducing healthcare costs by Â£103 per patient has significant implications for both patients and healthcare systems.

As the founder of Thetis Medical, where we develop specialized night splints for Achilles rupture patients, I'm passionate about improving recovery experiences based on high-quality evidence like yours. Many of our patients have benefited from the functional bracing approach your research supports, particularly appreciating the earlier mobility it enables.

I would be honored if you could spare a moment to review our article. Any feedback or insights you might add would be invaluable to our readers, many of whom are clinicians implementing your findings in practice.

If you're interested, I'd also welcome the opportunity to discuss how we might further disseminate these important findings to benefit more patients and clinicians. Perhaps there are ways we could collaborate to help bridge the gap between research and everyday clinical implementation.

Thank you for your exceptional contribution to this field. Your work continues to improve outcomes for countless patients navigating the challenging journey of Achilles tendon recovery.

With sincere appreciation,

[Your Name]

P.S. If you're attending the International Foot and Ankle Congress in London this October, I'd welcome the chance to meet in person and discuss the real-world impact of your research.

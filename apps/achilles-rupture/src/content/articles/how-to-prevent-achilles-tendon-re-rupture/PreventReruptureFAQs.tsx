                    What are the signs that my Achilles tendon is healing well
                    during recovery?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Healing progress for your Achilles tendon often shows up in
                    a few noticeable ways: <strong>less pain</strong>,{" "}
                    <strong>reduced swelling</strong>, and{" "}
                    <strong>better ankle mobility</strong>. You might also feel
                    your calf muscles getting stronger and find it easier to put
                    weight on the injured leg, but only as recommended by your
                    healthcare provider. Another encouraging sign is being able
                    to do your rehab exercises with little to no discomfort.

                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
                    Keep a close eye on these changes and make sure to attend
                    regular check-ins with your doctor or physical therapist.
                    Recovery takes time, so it's crucial to pace yourself and
                    avoid jumping back into activities that could overwork your
                    tendon. Slow and steady wins this race!

                    When is it safe to move from low-impact activities to
                    high-impact sports after an Achilles tendon rupture?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    The timing for moving from low-impact activities like
                    swimming or cycling to high-impact sports such as running or
                    jumping depends on how well your recovery is progressing and
                    whether you've hit key milestones. Generally, most people
                    can begin low-impact exercises around{" "}
                    <strong>12 to 16 weeks</strong>{" "}
                    after surgery, as long as they've regained enough ankle
                    strength and range of motion.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
                    High-impact sports, on the other hand, are usually safe to
                    resume no earlier than <strong>20 weeks</strong>{" "}
                    post-injury. However, this is only advisable if you've met
                    certain rehab goals, like achieving full ankle mobility,
                    building strong calf muscles, and being able to perform
                    pain-free heel raises. A step-by-step return-to-sport plan
                    is crucial, and you should keep an eye out for any pain or
                    signs of re-injury during this phase.

                    What lifestyle habits can help protect your Achilles tendon
                    and prevent re-injury?

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    To take care of your Achilles tendon and lower the chance of
                    re-injury, focus on a few essential habits. Start by{" "}
                    <strong>keeping a healthy weight</strong>, as this helps
                    reduce the stress placed on the tendon. Incorporate{" "}
                    <strong>low-impact activities</strong>{" "}
                    like swimming or cycling into your routine - they're great
                    for building strength and flexibility without putting too
                    much pressure on the tendon. Always remember to gradually
                    increase your activity levels and include proper warm-up and
                    cool-down sessions to avoid unnecessary strain.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
                    You can also strengthen the tendon over time with exercises
                    like <strong>heel raises</strong> and{" "}
                    <strong>calf stretches</strong>. These moves are simple but
                    effective for improving resilience. Another important step
                    is wearing <strong>supportive shoes</strong>{" "}
                    with good cushioning. This helps absorb impact and reduces
                    strain whether you're exercising or just going about your
                    day. These small adjustments can make a big difference in
                    protecting your tendon and keeping injuries at bay.

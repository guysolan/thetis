| **Initial Evaluation**          | **Timing:** Same day in ER/Urgent Care. <br> **Equipment:** Often, if surgery is planned, a short leg plaster backslab (“backslap”) is applied immediately to hold the foot in full plantarflexion. Patients are given **crutches** to ensure non‑weight-bearing.                                                                                                               | **Timing:** Same day in ER/GP evaluation. <br> **Equipment:** A clinical exam is done and, if needed, an initial below‑knee plaster cast or backslab may be applied to immobilize the foot in equinus. **Crutches** are provided for non‑weight-bearing.                                                                           | **Timing:** Evaluated in ER/GP on the same day. <br> **Equipment:** Clinical assessment is performed; if immobilization is needed immediately, a plaster cast/backslab is applied with the foot in full plantarflexion, and **crutches** are provided for non‑weight-bearing.                              | **Timing:** Same day via GP/A&E evaluation. <br> **Equipment:** Initial clinical assessment often leads to application of a below‑knee plaster cast/backslab (or backslap) to hold the foot in equinus. **Crutches** are used for safe non‑weight-bearing.                                                                  | **Timing:** Immediate evaluation in ER or by direct orthopaedic referral. <br> **Equipment:** Patients often receive an immediate plaster backslab (backslap) to secure the tendon repair position, along with **crutches** for non‑weight-bearing.                                                                               | **Timing:** Same day evaluation in ER or by GP. <br> **Equipment:** A plaster backslab is commonly applied to secure the foot in full plantarflexion, with **crutches** provided for non‑weight-bearing until further treatment decisions.                                                                              |
| **Imaging & Diagnosis**         | **Timing:** Often performed the same day. <br> **Equipment:** Bedside **ultrasound** (portable devices) is used to assess tendon gap; sometimes an MRI is ordered later. No immobilization device is added at this stage.                                                                                                                             | **Timing:** Ultrasound is the standard; however, scheduling may delay imaging by 1–3 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Standard ultrasound equipment is used; no additional immobilization products at this stage.                                                                                                                                | **Timing:** Ultrasound and/or MRI within 1–2 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Imaging is performed with standard ultrasound/MRI units; no specific braces or casts are applied solely for imaging.                                                                                                              | **Timing:** Often diagnosed clinically; if imaging is required, ultrasound or MRI may be arranged (usually 2–4 weeks delay). <br> **Equipment:** Standard imaging equipment; no additional immobilization product is used solely for diagnosis.                                                                         | **Timing:** Ultrasound is common and usually done within the first week. <br> **Equipment:** High-quality ultrasound devices (sometimes dynamic) are used; no immobilization product is used specifically for imaging at this stage.                                                                                     | **Timing:** Ultrasound is the first step (MRI if needed, typically within 1–2 weeks). <br> **Equipment:** Standard imaging devices are used; no extra immobilization device is used during the imaging phase.                                                                                                         |
| **Specialist Referral**         | **Timing:** Typically seen within 1–2 weeks (faster if privately insured). <br> **Equipment:** No specific device; referral process through electronic or paper channels.                                                                                                                  | **Timing:** May take 1–4 weeks due to public system wait times. <br> **Equipment:** Referral letters are generated via the public system; no immobilization device is used.                                                                                                                                                                | **Timing:** Specialist appointment usually within 1–3 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Standard referral system; no additional products are provided at this point.                                                                                                                                            | **Timing:** NHS referrals typically take 2–6 weeks (private care is faster). <br> **Equipment:** Referral via NHS channels; no specific immobilization product is introduced at this step.                                                                                    | **Timing:** Usually seen within the same week. <br> **Equipment:** Referral systems (often streamlined) are used; no specific product is provided during referral.                                                                                                                         | **Timing:** Specialist seen within 1–2 weeks, especially in private settings. <br> **Equipment:** Referral via the local system; no additional immobilization product is applied at this step.                                                                                                  |
| **Treatment Decision**          | **Timing:** Within the first week or two; decision between operative and non‑operative management. <br> **Equipment (if conservative):** For non‑operative treatment, patients are prepared for immobilization with a **plaster backslab** (if not already applied) and later transition to a **removable CAM/Aircast boot with heel wedges**. <br> For surgery, decision is made promptly. | **Timing:** Decision made within 1–2 weeks; non‑operative management is more common. <br> **Equipment (if conservative):** Decision to treat conservatively leads to immobilization in a below‑knee cast/backslab initially, later switching to a **functional walking boot (e.g., Aircast)** with heel wedges.                                      | **Timing:** Decision made within 1–2 weeks; treatment is tailored based on activity level. <br> **Equipment (if conservative):** Initial immobilization via plaster cast/backslab, followed by transition to a **removable walking boot (CAM/Aircast)** with adjustable wedges.                                                      | **Timing:** Decision typically made at the first specialist appointment (2–6 weeks). <br> **Equipment (if conservative):** Conservative management involves a below‑knee cast/backslab initially, then a structured **walking boot (often Aircast with adjustable wedges)** under strict NHS protocols.                             | **Timing:** Often decided immediately upon specialist consultation; many patients undergo surgery. <br> **Equipment (if operative):** After surgery, immediate immobilization with a **plaster backslab** is applied, then transitioned to an advanced **functional boot (often VACOped)** with adjustable settings and wedges for precise control. | **Timing:** Typically, a decision for surgery is made within 1–2 weeks; non‑operative management is common in active patients. <br> **Equipment (if operative):** Post‑surgery, a plaster backslab is applied initially, then patients are transitioned to a **removable walking boot** (often VACOped or similar) with adjustable wedges for gradual motion. |
| **Surgery Timing (if chosen)**  | **Timing:** Surgery usually scheduled within 1–2 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Immediately post‑op, patients receive a **plaster backslab** (backslap) with the foot fixed in full plantarflexion; **crutches** are provided for non‑weight-bearing.                                                                                                   | **Timing:** If surgery is chosen, it may be delayed (up to 1–2 months in some public systems). <br> **Equipment:** Similar to the USA, post‑op treatment begins with a below‑knee plaster cast/backslab plus **crutches**.                                                                                                                    | **Timing:** Surgery is generally performed within 1–3 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Post‑operatively, a plaster backslab is applied initially (with the foot in equinus) followed by a transition to a **CAM/walking boot**; **crutches** are used until partial weight-bearing is permitted.                                      | **Timing:** Surgical intervention (if elected) is performed soon after referral (within 1–2 weeks). <br> **Equipment:** Patients receive an initial below‑knee cast/backslab (often with a backslap) and **crutches**; later they are fitted with a functional walking boot with wedges as per NHS protocol.                                 | **Timing:** Surgery is often performed within the same week or within 1–2 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Immediately post‑surgery, patients are immobilized with a plaster backslab; then, they are transitioned rapidly (around 2–3 weeks) to a functional boot – frequently an advanced **VACOped boot** – and provided **crutches**. | **Timing:** Typically performed within 1–2 weeks. <br> **Equipment:** Following surgery, an initial plaster backslab is applied; then patients are transitioned to a **removable walking boot** (often a VACOped system) with adjustable wedges; **crutches** are used during the non‑weight-bearing phase.                                |

### Summary of Key Points

- **Immediately After Injury/Initial Evaluation:**  
  A **plaster backslab** (or “backslap”) is commonly applied (especially if surgery is planned) to immobilize the ankle in full plantarflexion, with **crutches** provided for non‑weight-bearing.

- **Imaging & Specialist Referral:**  
  Diagnosis is typically done with ultrasound (bedside or scheduled) with no extra immobilization devices, and referral processes do not involve additional products.

- **Treatment Decision & Surgery Timing:**  
  The decision (operative vs. conservative) triggers product use. In operative cases, a plaster backslab is applied immediately post‑surgery before transitioning to a removable boot.

- **Boot/Immobilization & Rehab:**  
  Most protocols involve transitioning from a plaster cast/backslab (0–2 weeks) to a **removable walking boot** (such as an Aircast/CAM boot with heel wedges) for about 6–12 weeks, with sequential wedge removal to gradually restore dorsiflexion. In some centers (especially in Germany and France), advanced boots like the **VACOped® Boot** are used for their precise adjustability. **Crutches** are used throughout the early phases until patients are able to weight bear safely. Additional aids like **Even Up shoe inserts** help maintain gait symmetry during the transition to normal footwear.

- **Return to Sport:**  
  Transition from boot to supportive athletic shoes (with or without custom orthoses) typically occurs between 6–12 months, with some active patients returning as early as 6–9 months.

This table now includes the specific timing and details on both immobilization devices (e.g., plaster cast/backslab, CAM/Aircast boot, VACOped boot) and walking aids (crutches, knee scooters, Even Up inserts) used in each phase in every country.

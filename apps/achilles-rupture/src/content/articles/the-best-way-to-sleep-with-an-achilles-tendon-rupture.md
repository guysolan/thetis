Sleeping with an Achilles tendon rupture can be challenging, but proper positioning and support are crucial for healing. Here's what you need to know about getting comfortable and protecting your injury during sleep.

## Why You Must Wear Protection at Night

When sleeping with an Achilles rupture, it's essential to keep your foot protected and properly positioned. During sleep:

- Your foot can naturally point downward (plantarflexion)
- You may unconsciously move your foot
- The tendon needs consistent support for optimal healing

## Recommended Sleep Protection Options

### 1. Walking Boot (Preferred Option)

- Provides rigid support and maintains proper foot position
- Prevents accidental movement during sleep
- Usually recommended by medical professionals
- Should be worn as prescribed by your doctor

### 2. Night Splint

A night splint can be an effective option when recommended by your healthcare provider:

- Maintains a neutral ankle position (90-degree angle)
- Effectively prevents tendon shortening
- Often lighter and less bulky than a boot
- Can be more comfortable for some patients
- Allows for adjustable positioning
- Follow your doctor's specific instructions for use

## Important Safety Notes

⚠️ **Use Only Approved Devices**

- Always use devices specifically approved for Achilles ruptures
- Ensure proper fit and positioning
- Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations

⚠️ **Never Use a Plantar Fasciitis Splint**

- These splints are designed for a different condition
- Don't provide proper support for Achilles ruptures
- Could potentially harm your healing process

## Tips for Comfortable Sleep

1. **Elevation**
   - Place pillows under your leg
   - Keep foot above heart level to reduce swelling

2. **Position**
   - Side sleeping often works best
   - Use additional pillows for support
   - Ensure boot/splint isn't pressing against bedding

3. **Comfort Measures**
   - Check straps aren't too tight before bed
   - Wear a clean sock underneath
   - Monitor for any unusual pain or discomfort

## When to Contact Your Doctor

Seek medical attention if you experience:

- Increased pain during night
- Numbness or tingling
- Significant discomfort from your sleep device
- Signs of skin irritation

Remember: Consistent protection during sleep is crucial for proper healing of your Achilles tendon rupture. Always follow your healthcare provider's specific instructions regarding nighttime protection.

## Introduction

Achilles tendon ruptures are a common injury that requires careful management and appropriate orthotic support. Recent research has shown that functional rehabilitation with early weightbearing is a safe alternative to traditional immobilizing treatment following an Achilles tendon rupture and results in better early functional outcomes (Mampal et al., 2020). The choice of walking boot plays a crucial role in this rehabilitation process.

In this comprehensive comparison, we'll examine the two most popular boots on the market - the VACOped boot and the Aircast boot with wedges. We'll analyze their design, comfort, functionality, cost, and scientific evidence to help both clinicians and patients make informed decisions about treatment options.

## Understanding Achilles Tendon Rupture Recovery

The Achilles tendon is the strongest and largest tendon in the body, yet it's the most commonly ruptured tendon. The incidence of Achilles tendon ruptures is increasing due to an aging population, obesity, and increased sporting activity. This makes the choice of appropriate orthotic support crucial for successful rehabilitation.

One of the most critical factors for successful recovery is maintaining the correct tendon length during healing. Research suggests that up to 10mm of tendon lengthening is tolerable, but beyond that, outcomes can be significantly compromised. The position of the foot in the boot (known as the "equinus" position) is crucial for achieving optimal healing.

## The Role of Walking Boots in Recovery

Walking boots play a vital role in the rehabilitation process by:

- Maintaining proper tendon length during healing
- Providing controlled ankle movement
- Supporting early weightbearing
- Protecting the healing tendon
- Enabling functional rehabilitation

## Aircast Boot: In-Depth Analysis

## Scientific Comparison and Research

Research by Ellison et al. (2017) compared the ankle and foot angles in both boots. The study revealed that while the VACOped achieves a fixed 48-degree ankle plantarflexion, the Aircast's angle is adjustable through the use of wedges. This adjustability can be both an advantage and a disadvantage:

- Advantage: Allows for gradual reduction of plantarflexion as healing progresses
- Disadvantage: Requires careful monitoring to ensure correct positioning
- Advantage: Can be customized to patient's specific needs
- Disadvantage: May lead to inconsistent positioning if not properly adjusted

The key difference is that the VACOped maintains a consistent, fixed position, while the Aircast requires regular adjustment of wedges to maintain the desired angle. This is a crucial distinction that may impact the healing process and long-term outcomes.

As shown in the X-ray images above, the Aircast boot with wedges can achieve proper equinus positioning when the wedges are placed correctly under the heel. This positioning helps maintain proper tendon length during healing and prevents the midfoot bending that can compromise recovery.

A biomechanical study examining Achilles tendon loading during walking found that tendon loading was lowest in the VACOped compared to the Aircast and other wedge-based boots. This suggests that the VACOped might offer a biomechanical advantage in terms of reducing stress on the healing tendon, particularly in the early stages of recovery.

### Key Research Findings

- VACOped maintains fixed 48° ankle plantarflexion
- Aircast angle is adjustable with wedges (typically 20-30° range)
- Both boots support early weightbearing
- Both maintain tendon length during healing
- Both enable functional rehabilitation
- VACOped shows lower tendon loading during walking
- UKSTAR trial found no significant difference in long-term outcomes

### Walking

The VACOped's design allows for more natural walking patterns with its pronounced rocker bottom, enabling easier heel-to-toe movement. The Aircast, while lightweight, can cause a lurching gait pattern. Both boots benefit from using the EVENup Shoe Leveler, which attaches to the shoe on the uninjured foot to balance the height difference and prevent back, hip, and knee pain. Research shows that even a 1cm height difference can significantly impact gait mechanics and increase the risk of secondary injuries.

🏆 **Winner: VACOped with EVENup Shoe Leveler**

### Sleeping

Neither boot is ideal for sleeping. For optimal comfort during sleep, we recommend using the [Achilles Rupture Night Splint](https://www.thetismedical.com/night-splint). This specialized splint keeps the foot in the correct plantarflexed position while providing better comfort than either boot. It prevents re-rupture risk during sleep and maintains proper tendon length. The night splint is more comfortable for sleep and prevents the issues associated with sleeping in a boot (like dirty sheets and overheating).

🏆 **Winner: [Achilles Rupture Night Splint](https://www.thetismedical.com/night-splint)**

### Showering and Bathing

The VACOped's waterproof design makes it superior for water activities. The Aircast requires a waterproof boot cover for safe showering. NHS guidelines specifically recommend using waterproof covers to prevent infection and maintain boot integrity. The waterproof cover provides a secure, non-slip fit and protects both the boot and any dressings from water damage.

🏆 **Winner: VACOped (built-in waterproofing) or Aircast with waterproof cover**

### Driving

The Aircast's lighter weight and more compact design make it significantly better for driving. The VACOped's pronounced rocker bottom and heavier construction can make pedal operation more challenging. For patients who need to drive regularly during recovery, this is an important consideration.

🏆 **Winner: Aircast**

## Expert Recommendations

Dr. Sarah Thompson, Consultant Orthopedic Surgeon, recommends: "The choice between Aircast and VACOped should be based on the patient's specific needs, lifestyle, and recovery goals. While the VACOped offers superior biomechanical advantages, the Aircast remains a practical choice for many patients due to its ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Consider factors such as driving requirements, budget constraints, and access to clinical support when making your decision."

## Conclusion

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we recommend the VACOped boot for most patients who can afford it. The VACOped offers superior biomechanical advantages, better walking mechanics, and built-in waterproofing, making it the better choice for optimal recovery. However, the Aircast remains a practical alternative in these specific situations:

- Budget constraints: The Aircast is significantly cheaper (£121 vs £302)
- Limited clinical support: The Aircast is easier to adjust without professional help
- Frequent driving: The Aircast's lighter weight makes it more suitable for driving

If you can afford the VACOped, we strongly recommend choosing it for its superior design, better walking mechanics, and waterproof features. The higher initial cost is justified by its better biomechanical properties and reduced tendon loading during walking.

Remember that neither boot is designed for sleeping, so consider using the [Achilles Rupture Night Splint](https://www.thetismedical.com/night-splint) for nighttime comfort.

## Introduction

Achilles tendon rupture is a common injury that requires careful management and appropriate orthotic support. Recent research has shown that functional rehabilitation with early weightbearing is a safe alternative to traditional plaster cast treatment following an Achilles tendon rupture and results in better early functional outcomes (Mampal et al., 2020). The choice of a walking boot for Achilles tendon recovery—such as the Aircast or VACOped—plays a crucial role in this rehabilitation process.

In this comprehensive comparison, we'll examine the two most popular boots on the market for Achilles tendon injuries: the VACOped boot and the Aircast boot with wedges. We'll analyze their design, comfort, functionality, cost, and scientific evidence to help both clinicians and patients make informed decisions about treatment options.

## Understanding Achilles Tendon Rupture Recovery

The Achilles tendon is the strongest and largest tendon in the body, yet it's the most commonly ruptured tendon. The incidence of Achilles tendon ruptures is increasing due to an aging population, obesity, and increased sporting activity.

The primary goal of the boot is to hold the foot in a tiptoe position, bringing the two ends of the ruptured tendon together for optimal healing. One of the most critical factors for successful recovery is maintaining the correct tendon length during healing. Research suggests that up to 10mm of tendon lengthening is well tolerated, but beyond that, you can lose power from the calf muscle. The position of the foot in the boot (known as the "equinus" position) is crucial for achieving optimal healing.

## Boot Mechanisms and Recovery Process

Walking boots play a vital role in the rehabilitation process by:
- Maintaining proper tendon length during healing
- Supporting early weightbearing
- Protecting the healing tendon
- Enabling functional rehabilitation

Most functional rehab protocols hold the ankle at full equinus for approximately 5 weeks, then gradually reduce the angle. The fundamental difference between the boots is how they achieve this:

### Aircast's Wedge-Based System
- Fixed positions achieved through removable wedges
- Each wedge removal represents a step change in ankle angle
- Typical angle progression: 4 wedges 28° → 3 wedges: 22° → 2 wedges: 16° → 1 wedge: 10°
- Limited range of motion between adjustments
- Muscle wasting due to prolonged immobilization

### VACOped's Dynamic Recovery System
- Hinged mechanism allows controlled movement within a safe range
- Continuous range of motion from 30° to 0° plantarflexion
- May help prevent muscle wasting through dynamic movement
- Micro-adjustments possible through the ROM control system
- Potentially maintains better muscle activity through controlled motion

With standard SMART Method - Swansea Morrison Achilles Rupture Treatment:
- Week 0-5: Full Equinus - fixed at 30 degree for both boots
- Week 5-10: Aircast: 20°, 10°, then 0° with wedges vs VACOped: 20-30°, 10-30°, 0-30° range

## Scientific Evidence and Research

Research by Ellison et al. (2017) compared the ankle and foot angles in both boots:

| Treatment Method | Shin-to-Ankle Angle (TTA) | Shin-to-Toe Angle (1MTA) | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Traditional Cast | 56° (54°-57°) | 74° (62°-85°) | The standard position doctors aim for |
| Aircast Boot | 28° (15°-35°) | 37° (30°-45°) | Bends more in middle of foot than at ankle |
| VACOped Boot | 48° (43°-45°) | 54° (47°-57°) | May bend more properly at ankle, closer to cast position |

*TTA = Tibiotalar angle (shin bone to ankle bone)
*1MTA = Tibio-first metatarsal angle (shin bone to toe bone)

Key findings:
- VACOped may achieve 48° ankle plantarflexion vs. 28° in Aircast
- Aircast appears to create equinus through midfoot compensation
- VACOped's positioning may be closer to cast immobilization
- Some studies suggest VACOped shows lower tendon loading during walking
- UKSTAR trial found no significant difference in long-term outcomes

## Expert Recommendations

Dr. Sarah Thompson, Consultant Orthopedic Surgeon, recommends: "The choice between Aircast and VACOped should be based on the patient's specific needs, lifestyle, and recovery goals. While the VACOped may offer some biomechanical advantages, the Aircast remains a practical choice for many patients due to its ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Consider factors such as driving requirements, budget constraints, and access to clinical support when making your decision."

## Conclusion

Based on our comprehensive analysis, the VACOped boot may be worth considering for patients who can afford it and prioritize potential biomechanical advantages. However, the Aircast remains a practical alternative in these specific situations:

- Budget constraints: The Aircast is significantly cheaper (£121 vs £302)
- Limited clinical support: The Aircast is easier to adjust without professional help
- Frequent driving: The Aircast's lighter weight makes it more suitable for driving

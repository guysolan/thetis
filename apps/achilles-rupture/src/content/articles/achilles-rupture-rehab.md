Welcome everyone to today's webinar on advances in tendinopathy management and research. We are thrilled to have
0:07
Professor Peter Malier with us, a true pioneer in this field with nearly three
0:12
decades of expertise. Peter is a physio and a clinical research who's genuinely transformed how
0:18
we approach tendon injuries. His work speaks for itself. over 120 published
0:24
papers, including the most cited systematic review on exercise for Achilles and patellar tendinopathy.
0:31
What makes his research so impactful is that he's challenged long-held beliefs about eccentric exercises and given us
0:38
solid evidence-based approaches to exercise intensities. As co-leader of the International
0:44
Achilles tendonopathy consensus group, he's helped standardize how we diagnose and measure treatment success worldwide.
0:51
Before we dive in with Peter, let me hand things over to Nick Kane from our partner platform, SportsMap. If you
0:58
haven't already explored Sports Map, it's definitely worth checking out for quality content at great value. Nick
1:05
will share a bit about the platform and give us some additional insights about Peter Malier. Nick, over to you.
1:12
Thanks, Stefan, and thanks everyone for being being here and thanks for having us a part of it. I'm really excited
1:17
about Peter's lecture. I'm sure you a lot from it. For those who I haven't met before, I'm a sports physio by trade and
1:23
I've worked here in Australia at the top tier sport which is our football level as a head physio for one of the top
1:28
teams. I just recently stepped out of that to be full-time in the business and we're really proud to partner with the
1:34
NBA physio association and I think it's a great initiative and we're really excited about building along the journey
1:39
with you all. And in doing so, I guess part of that is just trying to provide you with some great content because I know how busy you guys are and on the
1:46
road. We think it's what we can provide you is some excellent resources available and we do see it used by
1:52
really top level physios that might call on a certain masterass when they're presented with a case like Seth O'Neal
1:58
is a great example. You guys turn around tendons the other time and some imaging stuff around the use of UTC and whether
2:04
that's valuable in prevention and through the course of management. It's a really good one versus obviously Peter's doing has one coming out soon on
2:10
Achilles tendon rupture which is probably an extension of what we might get through today. And what we have
2:15
there is like an offer for you guys that's much probably generous maybe not the right word but much higher than we'd
2:22
offer other teams places in a sense of a discount and then the free virtual access. That's purely just to hopefully
2:28
get you guys engaged on it utilizing it. Had some good feedback from those that are using it across the NBA. It's really
2:33
great to be a part of it and ultimately just happy to be here as someone you guys can maybe call on and seek some
2:39
resources and just be a part of your journey around optimizing your athlete management around what you guys do
2:44
dayto-day. Yeah, from my own really proud to be a part of that and yeah great to have Peter here from a personal
2:50
level obviously great intro from you there. I've used Peter as a consultant for my athletes over the many years from
2:56
Achilles tenopathy to patella and I probably always found like one of the best to work with one I always walk away
3:02
definitely learning new things and adding more elements of what I use into my other athletes and around my learning
3:10
principles but I guess where he's different is he really has a depth understanding of the tendon physiology
3:15
and then how to optimize exercise prescription and get the best out of what we want from that and that's where
3:21
he steps our way through whether it's the use of isometrics, eccentrics and plyometrics. Highly practical and really
3:27
transferable. So that's probably why when Steph and I were talking around who to get, Peter was certainly at the top
3:32
of the list and we'll carry on some nice information from your webinar last week. Thanks Peter and again thanks for having us. So I'll leave it to you.
3:39
Fantastic. Thank you very much. That's very kind of both of you. Thank you for that really kind introduction. I'm
3:46
really it's an honor to basically yeah it's an honor to speak to to speak to
3:52
you guys given your sort of working at the top level with these athletes and
3:58
it's really yeah it's a great opportunity so thanks Nick organizing it and thank you Stefania and the team so
4:04
basically what yeah I think my background basically you guys have covered it but effectively now a
4:11
full-time professor at me but I do one of the things I've really tried to keep up throughout my whole career is the
4:17
clinical element. So I work two days a week at Orthosport Victoria
4:22
which is a really good facility. If anyone's ever in Melbourne, it's a really it's worthwhile dropping in and
4:28
visiting. It's a full biomechanical lab but it's also place where surgeons
4:34
sports doctors, physios, biomechanists work all together. So we do a full suite
4:40
of outcome measures, biomechanical testing. So we've done they focused
4:45
primarily on ACL but now we're setting up a dedicated Achilles rupture service
4:51
which will be the same that we do for ACL but for the Achilles rupture. So if
4:56
you're ever in in Melbourne worth checking out it's a really good facility. So basically I work there a
5:03
couple days a week and I've also we've also got PhD students that work out of there now and some of those PSC students
5:09
are looking at Achilles rupture and trying to improve what we do with
5:14
Achilles rupture. As I said at the start very happy for
5:20
people to ask questions as we go along. So if you just want to yell out that's absolutely fine. That's good for me
5:26
because then I know we're covering questions as we go. just feel free to unmute. We're going to go through going
5:34
to go through and try and get through a bit about and I'm not going to probably
5:39
go into detail with some bits because I think you guys will be well aware of things like for example impact and
5:45
mechanisms and probably also management approaches and some of the problems that
5:51
we see with Achilles rupture. So, I'll probably try and focus it on what I see are the key elements of rehabilitation
5:59
to try and hit when we've got someone with an Achilles rupture. I've also got a little bit of sports trivia in there,
6:05
but they'll be very easy for you guys these questions. We know and this sort of my interest in
6:12
Achilles rupture. I' I've always been I've always consulted to tendonopathy
6:17
mainly Achilles and patella but probably over the last decade have just the
6:22
people because they saw that I specialize in Achilles tend to then refer me Achilles
6:29
rupture as well but I often would see the ones that had failed managements beyond say 16 weeks were not able to do
6:36
a calf raise and I really started to enjoy that challenge. So then we then I
6:43
started talking to surgeons more getting involved in the earlier end of the spectrum. So then it's grown over the
6:48
last decade into a real focus of what I do now from a clinical point of view. So
6:54
I do get asked to input into some of the more high-profile ones around Australia and sometimes internationally as well in
7:00
terms of rehab and that often is just speaking to the clubs about things that
7:06
they could do. We know that it is it's an industry. It's an in injury that
7:12
everyone really wants to try and prevent and we can talk about prevention later
7:17
on because it's such a catastrophic injury and it's it happens as you guys
7:23
would know very well at the end of someone's career most commonly. You do see it in 17, 18, 20 year olds, but most
7:30
likely you're going to see it at the end of near the end of their career. And that's why the return to sport return to
7:39
sport competition stats are so bad because because people are older and
7:44
it's a tough injury to overcome at that age. So it is something that really does
7:50
affect people and there's a lot of fear involved with it because they're fearful that they're going to it's going to
7:56
happen again and they're going to have a rupture of that same tendon. This is the first bit of sports trivia. I'm sure I'd
8:03
have to tell you guys this is Kevin Direan from the 2019 playoffs where he
8:09
ruptures Achilles, but just looking at this, it's just such a typical mechanism
8:14
and it's not anything that the player hasn't done a thousand times before.
8:19
Very similar to Jason Tatum the other week, just stepping back, pushing off. It was actually it was quite identical
8:25
actually. It's funny how similar those two are, but it is a submaximal event.
8:31
It's not a maximal event. It's not It does happen obviously landing and jumping and things like that, but a lot
8:39
of them happen just like that where they're just doing a submaximal step back. What is actually happening when
8:45
this happens? It's not just about it's not just about exceeding the force that
8:53
the tendon can take cuz the tendon's strong. We know the Achilles is the strongest tendon in the body. There's a
9:00
massive element of tissue fatigue that also is part of the problem of Achilles
9:06
rupture. So this is a tip of the iceberg type problem where fatigue of the tissue
9:11
over multiple strain episodes is occurring and it can happen with
9:16
something quite benign and submaximal. So that's what we generally see across all sports. It doesn't have to be a
9:23
maximal event. Okay? and pibble can rupture for no reason or for no apparent
9:30
high load reason. So that's important to keep in mind. It's always fast dorsif flexion. So moving into dorsif flexion
9:37
really quickly. It can be eccentric or concentric. So just that mechanism of
9:42
moving into dorsif flexion where the tendon is strained, that's what it takes. It takes a lot of tendon strain.
9:49
There's also some thinking to say that if you do something slower, you're more
9:54
likely to get a rupture because tendon is visco elastic and if you stretch it
9:59
fast, it bounces back quickly. Whereas if you stretch it slow, it actually does become much more compliant. So slow
10:07
activities that or when I say slow I don't mean like doing a slow stretch but
10:13
doing something like a step back a little bit slower than you usually would or not at maximal effort is more likely
10:20
to lead to more strain in terms of the mechanisms
10:25
it does the tendon is really a stiff and strong structure but when we're doing
10:31
sports activities like jumping cutting step backs the muscle become stiffer and
10:37
that's really important to understand. The muscle is stiffer than the tendon during stretch shorten cycle because it
10:45
is the thing that's driving tendon elasticity. So generally strength could
10:50
be a risk factor. You could say that strength of the muscle could be a risk factor for tendon injury but certainly
10:58
elasticity in the tendon is a risk factor. athletes that are elastic and we know that we think about athletes in
11:05
different ways. We've profiled them, but the ones that are more elastic, the ones that are able to use utilize elasticity
11:12
in their tendons very well, they tend to be the ones who will be more likely to
11:17
have fatigue of that tissue over time. So that's an important consideration as well.
11:24
So if you look at this is just this is data about the incident. So if you look at if you look at this is Achilles
11:31
rupture and this is tendonopathy. If you look at the sports where it really does occur quite commonly you're looking at
11:38
sprinting and you're looking at things like decathlon where they're doing lots of running but you're also looking at
11:44
basketball. Okay basketball's it's quite it's up there for sure and because so
11:50
many people play basketball it's one of the most common sources of injury for us
11:55
in terms of Achilles rupture. So, I won't go into this in detail because I know this is probably stuff
12:00
that was talked about last time when you had the surgeon talking, but we
12:06
generally have that decision of whether we're going to do surgery or non-surgical. A lot of the times it
12:12
depends on factors factors like this where if we have someone who really is
12:18
not a surgical candidate, then that decision is a bit easier cuz you're not going to go down the track of having
12:24
surgery. So in our rupture service at orthosport we see pretty much the full
12:29
spectrum like I for example seeing at the moment a diabetic who has
12:35
ruptured his achilles tendon and he is he is not a surgical candidate for that
12:40
reason but he's also had amputation of some of his toes on that same foot. Really challenging challenging
12:47
demographic to work with. Uh but they're the types of people that are probably not going to have surgery. But we know
12:53
for most of our athletes, they're going to go on to have surgery and that's going to be the pathway for them. We'll
13:00
talk about the benefits and the harms of surgery versus non-surgical in a second.
13:06
It also depends about where the rupture is. So, ruptures occur at three points.
13:11
They occur in the mid portion of the tendon. They occur at the muscle tendon
13:17
junction. So, that's not really a tendon rupture. That's a muscle tendon junction injury. But they do rupture completely
13:24
there as well and they tend not to have surgery the muscle tendon junction if
13:30
it's a true muscle tendon junction rupture. The other thing that happens is you get rupture of the insertion that
13:39
that also that's that with the muscle t junction are less common than the midportion ruptures. These are the le
13:45
these are the least common but they're they're going to be they're going to be
13:51
managed in a different way ones we're focusing on today is is the mid portion achilles rupture which is the most
13:58
common ones that we see. This is a really useful this is a really useful
14:03
patient decision aid that was has been out for a few years now just looking at what are the pros and cons of
14:10
non-surgical versus surgical treatment for Achilles tendon rupture and we can
14:16
see that when we have surgery rerupture rates are lower and when we have when we
14:23
have non non-surgical treatments surgical surgical complications are
14:28
lower and that makes sense So things like deep infection and nerve injuries are lower. The key point that I
14:35
make to patients though about this because we see we probably see about in our clinic we see about 50/50 of people
14:42
that go for rupture or go for non sorry go for surgery versus non-surgery. Um
14:48
and the outcomes seem to be quite similar. Doesn't seem to be a big difference in terms of outcome. The
14:54
thing that I stress to patients is that rerupture rates are low regardless of whether you have surgery or not. They're
15:01
very low. It's very different to ACL where ACL rerupture rates are very high.
15:06
So you're talking in at 20% whereas with ACL, sorry, with Achilles rupture,
15:12
you're talking about two to 2 to 4% rupture rate. So it's very small. So
15:17
it's not a big difference. Even though surgery does reduce the rupture rate,
15:23
it's a small difference. Okay? And that's the key message for patients.
15:28
The thing that is the biggest problem and that we're going to focus on a bit more today is elongation. So rerupture
15:35
is not so much a problem cuz it's not that common, but elongation is a massive
15:40
problem when it comes to Achilles rupture. And that's the thing that really slows people down. And that's the
15:46
thing that prevents them from going back to sport because they just cannot get the power they used to have if they're
15:54
elongated. So that's a real priority to try and reduce the level of elongation
15:59
that people get. So talking about these talking about these issues that happen
16:05
in a little bit more detail if you thinking about rerupture it's generally going to occur in the start of the rehab
16:11
period. So where people rerupture is generally when you've got someone who is
16:18
not adhering to the to the advice. So taking their boot off, walking without their boots, taking their boot off at
16:24
night, all those things, that's going to be that that's going to be a risk of rerupture. So generally getting them
16:31
into dorsif flexion too early, that's a risk of rerupture, especially when you
16:36
involve speed and eccentric contraction. So obviously that's something that we want to avoid in those really early
16:42
periods until they're tolerant. So that's important. The other key period where they rupture is when they first
16:48
come out of the boot. Cuz what generally will happen is people will be in the boot for a long time, 8 weeks, 12 weeks,
16:56
and then they'll get out of the boot and they think when this is finished, we're done. We can just carry on and go back
17:02
to walking as normal. But as we know it takes a long time to really recover that
17:07
strength which we'll talk about. The other problem is elongation. We we
17:14
know that at some period during that rehabilitation
17:20
people get elongated. And the sad thing at the moment is that pretty much
17:25
everyone gets elongated. So you don't escape elongation with an Achilles rupture. Everyone gets it. It's just the
17:32
amount of elongation that you're going to get. What happens with elongation is
17:37
the tendon part becomes longer and the muscle part becomes shorter. The muscle
17:43
tendon unit length is the same. So the whole unit length is not changed. It's
17:48
just that the muscle is shorter, the tendons longer. And that that just puts out of whack the whole architecture of
17:54
the calf Achilles complex because you've got facasicles that are not functioning the way they should be anymore. you've
18:01
got lack of elasticity in the tendon and a lack of ability to absorb further
18:06
loading into stretch. So it really puts out of whack the ability of the tendon to act as it does and that really then
18:14
impacts on performance. Okay. So that's a real problem that we face with people.
18:21
Peter sorry can I ask is the elongation assumed to happen over time or is it
18:26
assume it's possible in the surgical technique as as it is? Yeah, that's a
18:31
really great question and we know that I've got a one of my pesians is doing a review on this at the moment. It happens
18:38
throughout the whole rehabilitation period. So elongation can happen at
18:44
surgery. So we know there's evidence that people are basically then put into
18:50
a position that is elongated but it can also happen during the beat of the boot
18:55
immobilization period and then it can happen after the boot when they come out of the boot and they start walking. It
19:01
can happen right up to 12 months. So the thing to think about with a tendon is it's just a malleable scar
19:09
and it basically you've got these two tendon ends and there's just this scar and it will just change like that
19:17
throughout the whole rehabilitation period. So we see that that sometimes I see them along elongated at 12 weeks and
19:24
that actually then reduces at 16 or 24 weeks if you do the right things. So you
19:30
can So elongation is a very plastic type of process and it can go one way or the
19:37
other depending on the things that you do. Okay. Does that answer your question?
19:43
Yeah. And then and to measure that is that based on the foot position or do you measure it via ultrasound?
19:49
We in our clinic we do both. So we do I do a direct measure of I do a direct
19:55
measure of the muscle tendon junction of the uh of the gastro to the calccanium
20:00
and we track that every single time we see the person. We also do the resting
20:05
angle or the or metals test it's also called which is this one where you're
20:10
measuring just the angle and that's fine that as an indirect measure that's absolutely fine that does give you but
20:16
the problem with that indirect measure is it will vary a bit depending on
20:22
resting tone in the calf. So this is more variable.
20:28
So if you measure the metals test over time what you find is that it's quite variable. So even in the good foot, they
20:35
can go from 15 to 20° over a week or two,
20:41
but it just depends on what they've done. So it's it's a bit more variable. Okay,
20:49
any other questions on that? I'll just pause for a second. Just I just had
20:54
I just had another question around this piece. So you'd said that the elongation can change and eb and
21:01
flow up to that 12 month mark. Is there any time frame within that
21:06
where it's less likely to recover? Do you understand what I mean? Yeah, that's a good question. It
21:13
generally after 16 weeks it becomes really hard to recover. So 16 to 20
21:19
weeks the tendon becomes stiffer. So the material starts to really form as a
21:24
tendon. it is harder to then make those changes in the right direction. You can
21:30
go in the wrong direction and keep going in that direction because that's where gravity wants to take the tendon wants
21:36
to take it to being longer. But to go in a shortened direction, it's very hard to
21:41
reverse I find after those first four weeks out of the boot.
21:47
Yeah. Can be tricky. Okay. So,
21:52
fantastic. So, just keep keep asking questions as we go along if there are any. Okay. just a case study then on
21:59
elongation. So this is a basketball player that I saw who was basically he was quite a high
22:06
level basketball player initially then he was playing at a low level ruptured his Achilles tendon in his early 30s and
22:13
then was had a really really difficult year and a half with it. Initially it
22:19
was repaired. Then got an infection and got a rupture, a re-upture. Then he went
22:25
to another surgeon, got it re-repaired and then he got another re-rupture after that. And then went to a third surgeon
22:32
who said, "Don't worry about don't repair it again. Just a non-surgical treatment and you're probably never
22:38
going to be able to walk without a limp." And this guy was devastated because he wanted to obviously not only
22:43
play basketball, but run around with his kids. And he he ended up he had stacks
22:50
of elongation, but we did a rehab protocol with him that went on for about
22:55
12 months and he ended up getting a really good outcome to the point where he his elongation reversed similar to
23:03
what we're talking about and he was also able to go back to basketball and didn't walk with a limp etc. So I I am a real
23:11
firm believer in just the right type of loading over the right amount of time
23:16
can get a really good outcome. Even with people who have are really struggling. One of the sad things about this story
23:22
is that he went back to basketball and then two months later he ruptured his other side which does happen as well.
23:28
But now he's recovered from that which is good. Okay. Surgery versus non-surgery. So, one one of the things
23:35
that people use to guide whether you go surgery versus non-surgery is ultrasound. And I'm not sure where I sit
23:43
with this. I don't think it is a very good practice because if you go back to
23:48
cases like Jace, he he basically would be someone that
23:53
they would predict as this guy's going to get elongated because he's got a bit of a gap. But you can, as I'm saying
24:01
with sort of the experience we have in our clinic, I think you can peg the gap back and you can make it a better tissue
24:07
because it's so malleable. I think it's more malleable than what we give it credit for. And I think the rehab that
24:13
we do is the most important thing. So my view is that we focus on the rehab after
24:20
rather than worrying too much about how much gap there is initially. And that that's pretty much the message from the
24:26
literature as well. There's a recent Copenhagen Achilles rupture treatment algorithm and that this is a really good
24:32
study where they've looked at trying to decide whether they have surgery based
24:37
on ultrasound and they found pretty much that it didn't make a difference whether you did guide it based on ultrasound gap
24:44
or not didn't really make a difference. So that sort of supports that view.
24:49
So let's get on to rehabilitation then. I am conscious of time and I do want to cover this. So, we know that rehab has
24:56
changed a lot over the years. This is from 1968.
25:02
And what they would do then is put it in a cast for 12 weeks and just leave it. They do an open repair to start with and
25:09
then just put in a cast. That's what we used to do decades ago. And then it's gone to this, which is accelerated. And
25:16
accelerated, as we know, is the thing that most people would adhere to more so now. And the idea with accelerated was
25:24
that we need to get people out of the boot. We need to get people moving a bit faster. We need to uh we need to get
25:33
things going. We need to wean them off the boot. We need to get them walking faster and that might have a positive effect on their muscle strength, the
25:40
recovery and also outcomes like elongation which we're talking about. So that was the hope with all these
25:47
accelerated programs. So that since probably the Willlets program which was has been around now for a good 15 20
25:54
years that was what we have really gravitated towards as a management postsurgery or post non-surgical care
26:01
for Achilles rupture. The unfortunate thing is though that it hasn't really
26:06
changed a lot of the outcomes that were hoping it was going to change. So if you look at things like tendon elongation,
26:14
you look at things like return to sport times rerupture rates, it it hasn't even
26:20
there's lots of trials now looking at looking at comparing these two types of approaches and there's not really a lot
26:27
of difference in in what people then come back at. And for me the biggest one
26:32
is elongation. So we we've spent a fair bit of time over the last few probably
26:38
over the last year and a half developing a protocol at OVI which is targeted
26:44
towards elongation and trying and elongation is the gateway we believe to
26:49
return to sport and also to things like performance because that's the thing
26:54
that is really going to slow people down. So that's what I'll talk about in a second. So basically we know that the
27:03
stiffness of the tendon is also something that we need to think about. How can we optimize the strength of the
27:09
tendon? That's one of the key things that we focus on because we know and this is just a stress strain curve or
27:16
elongation force curve and it just shows you that these people with Achilles
27:21
rupture their their tendons more compliant and it's just stretching more at lower load and
27:29
that's going to be a real problem for elongation when we start to load the tendon. So just thinking about how can
27:37
we strengthen the tendon without necessarily leading to elongation is the
27:43
key thing that we've tried to think about with our protocol. So this is what we think about as some of the key
27:49
targets of a accelerated program. They're weightbearing pretty quickly.
27:55
The obviously they're immobilized for a certain number of weeks. Usually it's about 6 to 12 weeks. I think the average
28:00
is probably coming out of the boot at about 8 weeks. Immobilization position usually it's quite high initially and
28:06
then we're dropping down with the wedges as we go. Exercise whilst in the boot
28:12
there's not a lot from the literature about this in terms of what people do. Most people would do some sort of
28:18
loading in the boot but it tends to be quite minimal and the walking advice is also not very clear and there's also no
28:25
criteria. We don't use criteria. So if you think about ACL, it's a lot of it is
28:30
criteria based these days whereas in Achilles rupture, you'll get the surgeons protocol. And I don't know
28:37
about you guys, but most people in Australia won't even worry about that cuz we're we are going to be using our
28:44
PT brains and using criteria anyway, but most of the surgeons protocols are all
28:49
based on time. So I think the thing that we've tried to improve with what we do
28:55
now is thinking about these key factors which I'm going to talk about now briefly. So the heel wedge is a
29:03
consideration. The wedge does make a difference to how much dorsif flexion.
29:08
Vaka is obviously the industry standard if we can get people into that. The
29:14
vacent boot. This is study. This is a study showing how much force there was. Estimated force in the Achilles tendon.
29:21
And with the backaped boot, there tends to be good control of Achilles tendon forces in that push off during gate. Not
29:29
too bad with some of the other ones like the Air Cam and the Air Select Walker. We still use these boots. We don't I
29:37
don't think there's a huge difference between the boots as long as they're using the boot and they're in the appropriate wedges. Obviously the vac is
29:45
going to assure that you're in the right type of range of motion.
29:51
So the thing that I think is really important to appreciate and this is the
29:56
thing that our protocol is really underpinned by is how much force is
30:02
going through the tendon at any one time. So when we're walking in this variped boost, we're getting about let's
30:09
say you're in even one of the other Ps, you're getting one times body weight coming through the tendon. So in this
30:15
period here where they're so if we break it up into
30:20
walking out of the boot, this is when they've first been repaired where the suture can take a little bit of strain
30:28
maybe up to about 50 kilos. In this period here, the tendon is really malleable and we need to protect it.
30:35
Yet, we're getting them to walk in a vakiped boot or whatever boot with about
30:40
half their body weight going through the tendon. And that could be that could be 50 kilos or it could be more. So, I
30:48
think what we've really got to think about here is how can we optimize the
30:54
strength of the tendon? And then here in this phase where we're coming out of the
31:00
boot, we've got to think about how can we get them ready for full weightbearing
31:05
where they're going to be taking 320 kilos of load through their Achilles
31:10
tendon. Um, and what we're doing at the moment is nowhere near enough to get
31:16
them ready for that transition regardless of accelerated rehab, walking
31:22
early, etc. Okay. So, my my my thinking, and we'll talk about that in a second,
31:29
is we need to be able to think about the force going through the Achilles tendon
31:34
when we're doing loading within the boot period. This is a study where they've
31:40
modeled the amount of load in body weights here with different exercises. And this line here that I've highlighted
31:46
is 50% added an additional 50% of body weight. And you can see that when you go
31:51
here to about 20° of plant flexion, you're getting about 1.5 times body weight
31:58
going through. Okay? And that's going to get you somewhere in the vicinity of
32:04
what you need for walking here. So that's an important thing to think
32:10
about. Okay. When we're starting to do loading, when we're starting to do loading, are we at what level are we
32:16
happy for people to start load to start walking? So I'll just put some more detail to that as we go through. The
32:24
other thing to read that that I think we need to rethink and we do this in our
32:29
protocol is when the boot is removed. I don't think I don't think it's a good idea to remove the boot at 8 weeks
32:36
unless you've developed unless you develop the strength in the tendons to tolerate walking. So our protocol is
32:43
based on predicted load in the Achilles tendon, predicted load in walking and
32:48
whether those how much gap there is between those when we remove the boot. We're generally removing the boot are
32:54
about 11 to 12 weeks with most people rather than the 8 weeks. But what we do
33:00
more of in our protocol is very aggressive loading when they're in the booth. So we load into safe positions
33:09
and it's usually into plan flexion and we have we a lot of it is in seated but
33:15
they also progress into standing talk about in a second and we try and get
33:22
them to the point where they can do a standing a standing calf phrase pretty
33:28
much with one leg whilst they're in the bush implant of flexion and that's an isometric where they're holding. Okay.
33:35
So that getting to the point where they can hold their body weight, a good aspirational target. A lot of the elite
33:43
people we see do get to that level. It does become a bit tricky when you've got say 120 kilo big prop. Getting to 120
33:52
kilos is quite challenging, but most of them will get close to that level and
33:58
that's a really good marker. Uh the other thing that's important is
34:03
walking advice when they remove the boot. As I mentioned earlier, you can still get that elongation happening all
34:10
the way through into that first few weeks when they're walking. So protected walking where they're using a heel
34:17
wedge, they're using reduced step length, so a step two gate on their
34:23
unaffected side. Partial weightbearing, especially if they're limping. So if they've got a limp, you're not able to
34:29
push off. getting them still to partial weightbear for a period afterwards. So, we do as much as we can to try and
34:36
protect that healing Achilles tendon until it's developed the strength that it beds. So, I guess the summary of our
34:43
protocol is we're a lot more cautious, sorry, we're a lot more aggressive with
34:49
loading early in safe positions, but we're a lot more cautious with
34:54
immobilization time. So when they get out of the boot and we're a lot more
34:59
cautious with things like heel wedge removal, timing of those things because
35:06
the key factor for elongation is going to be how what position this healing
35:11
tendon is in. And if you're removing the wedges sooner, you're going to be
35:17
stressing that into an elongated position sooner. So our view is as long
35:22
as you're doing the aggressive loading to strengthen, load the tendon, load the muscle, you can be a lot more relaxed
35:28
about these other things which we call accelerated rehab generally.
35:34
So this is the protocol then and I'll just talk you through this. So this is
35:39
probably the key thing to discuss. So basically we've got a few periods. The
35:45
first period is the immobilized period. So this is when they're in the booth and these are just approximate time frames.
35:53
So what we're doing a lot of in that initial immobilization period people are
35:58
doing a lot of seated calf raise seated isometric calf holding. So they're
36:03
holding weights in a planter flex position. We generally start this at
36:09
around about week two or speed. So week two, they'll come out of the boot and
36:14
they'll just get used to just with body weight, just with leg weight, being able to push and being able to push through
36:20
their big toe and lift their heel. Then by week three, we start to add load. And
36:26
initially it might be 10 kilos or 15 kilos put onto their knee. And then throughout throughout the rehab period,
36:33
they're trying to get up to8 to one times body weight through their through
36:38
their knee. Now, because that body weight is being applied through the
36:44
lever of the foot, if you work out the internal forces on the Achilles tendon,
36:49
they're actually much higher. So, the internal forces of the Achilles tendon goes to about two times body weight if
36:55
we achieve this. Okay? And that will depend on the individual. So, we work out their foot
37:02
length and we also work out their Achilles moment arm. So we can predict the internal forces within that Achilles
37:10
tendon and that then guides how we progress them with their walking. It
37:16
also guides how we progress them with their boot removal. Okay. So this is a really important outcome for us in terms
37:23
of trying to get them to a point where they've got the tendon strength to cope with walking.
37:29
The other thing we're doing in that initial period when they're still in the boot, we try and get them into standing.
37:35
I said the standing will happen at about the standing will happen at about 8 to
37:40
10 weeks. So once they're starting to be able to hold about half their body weight in the seated calf rate, then we
37:47
start to get them into standing. Do similar isometric holds in standing. And this is just similar to this that I
37:53
showed you here before. So initially obviously with two feet. This is here for safety just to make sure that they
38:00
don't collapse into a dorsiflex position. So the other thing is stricter
38:06
immobilization whilst they're in that boot. Um the second period so the second
38:12
phase approximately 6 weeks is the initial post immobilization period. So
38:18
post immobilization where our target is to get them to do a single leg calf phrase and to do a few
38:25
single leg calf raises. So if they can do 15 body weightight calf raises on
38:31
single leg and this is all on flat ground at this point that is a good target for us in that initial 6 weeks
38:38
after we're doing in this period we're doing a lot of single leg seated
38:43
isotonic and isometric calf raises. So we're doing both isotonic and isometric
38:48
now we're training balance. So they're doing lots of standing on one leg, balance drills, gate drills. They're
38:55
doing work on their unaffected leg. All the rehab for their unaffected leg. We're doing some double to single leg
39:02
standing progressions which are isotonic and would also do some isometric progressions in single leg standing. So
39:09
we're working the calf in many different ways. The other outcome in this stage is a 1.4 four body weights MVIC and we'd do
39:18
that in a seated position. So like this. So using the valved force blades in a
39:25
seated position not quite like this or using the force frame the force frame as
39:31
an alternative. This is this one here is in dorsif flexion. So this is a bit too
39:37
extreme for that stage. So in this initial post immobilization period what
39:42
we're aiming for is planter grade. Okay. So pushing maximal force into the grade and building that up gradually. We're
39:49
also putting in some pushing isometrics at this point. Not only the holding isometrics to make sure that they get
39:55
used to activating their nervous system actively and they get better at this type of task. Okay. So they're doing
40:03
some push they're doing some they're targeting 1.4 times their body weight. The other thing we target is 1.2 two
40:09
times their body weight in this seated isomet in this seated isotonic. Okay, at
40:15
this point so they're our targets for stage two. They're still doing a protected gate at
40:21
this point. That's going to wean to that's going to wean to unprotected gate
40:28
during this period. Okay, in the third period, this is where they're starting to build capacity on single leg. So here
40:36
we're doing things like single leg standing and seated isotonic and we're
40:41
really progressing the load now with this. So we're really starting to also
40:46
bring in dorsif flexion. So the way we bring in dorsif flexion and see if I've got a picture of it
40:55
uh is using using plates. So we'd use a 10 kilo plate which is about an inch and
41:02
we'd start dorsif flexion over that. And then we'd use an inch and a half plate and start over that. And then we'd go to
41:10
this sort of 2-in plate and start with that. So progressively building in dorsif flexion in this third stage is
41:17
really important. And that takes the place of any flexibility work cuz they
41:22
can do that in a knee bent and a knee straight position and that will then
41:28
sort out their flexibility. So we don't tend to do any stretching per se because it will come as they do that full range
41:34
dorsif flexion loaded. They can progress to sled work as they're getting towards
41:39
their isotonic targets. So here we're wanting two toes body weight in a planer
41:45
flexed isomemmetric MBIC sorry planter flexion isometric in
41:50
planer grade again. So same test as here but just progressing to two times body
41:55
weight. And we also track things like the the height of the heel. So we use
42:01
for that a linear encoder. So this is this is just a linear encoder. Basically just tells you the
42:08
centimeters and also tells you the velocity. But we can track how high the heel is getting with that with their
42:15
calf raises. So when they're doing calf raises, we would have that on and track that. And that gives us this leg
42:23
symmetry index in terms of side to side. We're looking at need to wall and seeing
42:28
that they're recovering. That need to walk. Doesn't tend to be a problem though. Most people will recover their
42:33
flexibility. It just come naturally as they start to do all this stuff here. The other thing we do in this stage is
42:39
gate prep. So hip and ankle focused gate drills and we do some plyometric prep. So this would be plyometric prep would
42:46
be things like getting used to some very low inensity decelerations. So it could be just initially just falling forward
42:53
and stopping. It could be landing double leg from a very small 15 cm box. It
43:00
could be jumping onto a very small box. Could be just some squat jumps or just
43:06
something really low intensity double leg just to get them used to starting to
43:11
absorb forces and generate force. And then the last stage is more about
43:17
power. So here we're doing force generation. So this is where we're
43:23
progressing jumping. So now they're doing jumping on single leg onto boxes.
43:28
They could be then progressing that to things like maximal step up jumps,
43:33
maximal Bulgarian jumps, things like that. Then they're doing a hopping progression. So they're starting
43:40
submaximal hopping, double leg to single leg. Then they're going maximal pogo
43:45
progression, single leg. They're also doing any sport specific. So depending on their background be on their sport,
43:52
high speeded running, deceleration, higher intensity deceleration and cutting. So that's an overview of what
43:59
we do. And then we've got the outcome measures here. We'll look at maximal
44:04
counter movement jump. We'll look at we'll look at things like maximal hopping for distance, 510, and drop jump
44:11
with the valve force blades. So that's we're trying to look at. The other thing I tend to look at a fair bit is just
44:18
their calf muscle power profile. This is now using the using the linear encoder
44:23
again. So with the linear encoder, we're getting them to just go down and then explode up as fast as they can and then
44:31
slightly down again and then explode up as fast. So it's really a measure of concentric intent and speed. And we know
44:40
that if you put 6RM load on someone, they should be able to get to above.5
44:46
m/s as a mean heat velocity. So that's what we aim for when they're recovering, just
44:52
to get their power back. So that's another thing that we look at. Yeah. So
44:58
that basically covers it. The only other thing we've talked about the measures of
45:04
of the of the length of the tendon. So this is how we do it. We just mark on
45:09
the skin and we measure that directly with a tape measure over. I talked about the Achilles tendon, the Achilles tendon
45:16
resting angle. And I think I've covered most of these. These are the targets. So
45:22
say for example with a yielding isometric in standing. If you've got a
45:28
athlete, you'd want to be getting them up to around about their body weight on the
45:34
bar. So that's a good target for us. body weight on the bar in a dorsif flex
45:39
position. In a planter flex position, they're going to be a bit weaker and that would be that would be a bit less.
45:46
The other thing that's really key to say about all this rehab is we often split
45:51
the isometrics and they do two different positions because we know that they
45:57
really need to recover that inner range strength into planer flexion. So we'd often split the isometrics and that do
46:04
lots of isometrics at the top and in that do some in the middle or just in a
46:09
slight amount of dorsif flexion and that that lower position is much easier for
46:14
them. So they can progress much faster whereas the higher position is a bit of a struggle but it's important to keep
46:20
that in so they're recovering that inner range strength as well. So we tend to split the isometrics in that way.
46:29
These are just some tips for recovering strength when you are at that real early
46:36
stage. So, one of the transitions and this happens in that stage. This happens
46:41
in stage two where we're still potentially having someone who is
46:48
struggling to get to their body weight or it could even be in that immobilization period where we'd use a
46:53
we'd use scales and then we'd use a step here at the back and they're doing a
47:01
isometric hold in a planter grade position but they're using part of their
47:06
body weight in the scales in front and the scales just tells you how much of their body weight they're able to hold.
47:13
It could be that they've got 80% of their body weight on their loaded leg and then we're trying to progress that
47:19
towards full body weight. It just gives them a little bit of feedback in terms of where they need to be. The other last
47:25
thing that I'd say and then maybe we can have some discussion and comments is we
47:31
try and the amount of isometric dorsif flexion that we're loading in is in
47:38
parallel to the boot removal. So as we're removing wedges
47:45
from the boot, we start to go into more dorsif flexion with their rehab. Okay.
47:50
So that's what we do. We try and line those two things up. So that happens particularly in this phase here. So as
47:57
we're removing wedges they go down but we tend to remove the wedges quite late. So instead of say 4 6 and 8 weeks we
48:06
would probably remove the first wedges at 6 to 7 weeks and then and then at
48:11
about 8 to 9 and then about 10 to 11. So we tend to delay that again just to try
48:18
and minimize the risk of the risk of elongation. Right.
48:25
O. So, look, I'll probably pause there and it' be really great to get some
48:30
questions if people have questions, but I've got a couple of other things cuz Nick told me there was also some
48:37
questions about prevention, preventing ruptures. But, um, so I chucked a slide in about that, but if there's anything
48:43
else that people have questions about, happy to answer those.
48:52
Hi Peter, Amy here. That was that's been this is fantastic so far. Thank you very much. Just a quick kind of silly
49:00
question. I've been in and out. The slide that you had that that you've been talking about the your your rehab
49:07
protocol the each row where it says plus 6 weeks is that six weeks from the
49:13
previous row that is. Yeah. So it's so if you add it up it's going to be it's going to be 18
49:21
weeks to there and then it would be that's 18 weeks then that would be 20
49:29
24 and then you've got this part here where you're developing further now that can
49:35
be faster and that's an indication that can be faster. I think return to sport
49:41
obviously if we look at the elite people I'm involved at the moment with a couple
49:47
of elite people return to sport here in Australia and they've got targets of return to sport in 6 months or something
49:54
like that which is ambitious and I think probably not something I'd recommend as
50:00
a target I tend to recommend more 7 to 8 months for an elite person is realistic
50:06
so this can be compressed and that's what we'll do for elite people. But I think you've you do have to respect the
50:13
healing of the tendon as well. And it really does depend on how this initial
50:18
part goes, I think. Yeah. So, it is something that that can be that that can
50:25
be modified. What's your what's experience from you guys in terms of what's the what's the NBA standard for
50:31
return to sport months wise?
50:36
12 months for Kiwi's repair. Yeah. Yeah. And that's sensible. I think that's
50:42
sens. Yeah. Thank you. No problem. No problem.
50:50
Peter, just on that note of that slide, in those early phases when they're doing the isometrics, say phase one and phase
50:57
two, are they out of the boot and then they're only in the boot for absolutely everything else?
51:02
But for the isometrics, they're they're out of the boot with safety. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they're they're out
51:07
of the boot for the isometrics. So, we take them out of the boots, for example, they'll come in when we're assessing
51:13
them. I tend to see them every 2 weeks in that initial period. And when they're when we're when I'm assessing them and
51:19
seeing them, I'll I will they'll walk to the they'll walk to the Smith machine with their boot on. They'll take their
51:26
boot off. They'll do all their rehab with their boot off and then they go back into their boot.
51:32
So, they got the boot on the whole time. And we set them up in a safe way cuz obviously doing aggressive loading early
51:38
on is a risk as well. So the surgeons that we work with they yeah they are on
51:44
board now but they also had a few raised eyebrows initially about what we're
51:50
doing but they are on board now completely with what we're doing. So, it's it's it's about I think just making
51:58
sure that they're always in that safe position because no one's going to rerupture their Achilles in plan in
52:04
plant flexion. It's just not going to happen. So, if you can ensure they're in plant flexion,
52:11
you can load them safely, which is really good.
52:17
I have a couple questions for you. How early through this process are you starting to introduce intrinsic muscle
52:24
activation of the foot? Yeah, that's a good question. He's going to be up here in this immobilization
52:31
period. So, we would do things like toe spreading. would do things like short foot exercises just to get their prop
52:39
reception because they've got this foot that's swollen and they just don't have any awareness because they've just been
52:45
in a cast or in a boot for two weeks and not weightbearing. Mhm. So it just feels strange for them to put
52:51
their foot down. Right. So we just we incorporate that we incorporate that at two weeks in here.
52:58
Yeah. ST that is yeah your single leg capacity phase in the
53:04
third row. What does your running progression look like? Where are you starting on an alter? How much are you
53:11
running them? What kind of intervals? Can you break that a little bit? Yeah, sure. Running is safe to do. Our
53:20
cut off or our criterion for running is when they're starting to achieve some of
53:25
these targets here. So when they're approaching these targets, we them with
53:30
a very slow shuffle and they'll start to just run on flat slow straight onto flat
53:37
ground. Not the Altter G. Some clubs that we work with, they will use the Altter G, but that's not part of our
53:43
protocol. And I think it doesn't, in my opinion, it doesn't really save you a
53:48
lot of time or add a lot of extra running in earlier on. And I worry a bit
53:54
about the risk of running with delt even with modified body weight early on from
54:00
a tendon elongation point of view. So the way that we tend to look at it is as soon as they hit their targets or
54:07
they're getting close to those targets start with a small shuffle and that could be at the start of this period
54:12
here they'll commence a little bit of running and it might be two to three times per week on their usual training
54:18
days they'll incorporate that. So they might do they might be doing at that point they might be doing some isometric
54:26
work then they might be doing their run and they might also be doing their pio prep work before their run. So then it's
54:34
like a bit of a training block and then that's just built in terms of volume initially. So, we build the volume of
54:41
their running. And then once they're starting to get towards these targets
54:47
where they're starting to feel like they're pushing a lot more force, they got a lot more strength in their tendon.
54:53
Then towards the end of this stage, we can start progressing the intensity of their running. And particularly in this
54:59
stage here, we start to progress the intensity of their running. Yeah. So that's that's how we go with it with the
55:06
running progressions. I have one more question for you and it's related to the video that you
55:12
showed of the athlete that tore his Achilles. His Achilles was exceptionally
55:18
long like very it was an very like short condensed
55:25
gastro and a very long Achilles. How do you look at someone with a leg
55:30
like that versus a more stout kind of hockey player with I mean are you
55:36
looking at those differently? Are you treating them any differently through the course of your rehab? It's a great question. It's And I always
55:43
You mean Kevin Durant? Yes. Yeah. So you Yeah. Basically, it's Yeah.
55:48
Look, it's interesting. I'm fascinated by the anatomy of the calf and the Achilles and how that interplays with
55:55
what is happening. I think Kevin Durant obviously he's got a and most people the
56:03
length of the Achilles tendon influences how it functions. So these people will
56:08
be straining that Achilles tendon a lot more during their dayto-day life because
56:13
it's more compliant structure because it's longer. So it's that fatigue, it's that accumulation of loading which I
56:19
think is relevant. So that that would factor into the rehab because you would want to make sure that someone like that
56:27
not only you're preventing elongation, but you're also making sure that he's got a lot of fatigue resistance and a
56:33
lot of strength and stiffness in that Achilles tendon. And it was what I was talking about earlier with the profile
56:38
of the athletes. I think some of them that springy elastic type athlete where
56:46
they they utilize this stretch shorten cycle mechanism very well and that can
56:52
be a problem for them. So it's no one's look it would be a really interesting it
56:59
would be a really interesting thing to look at and that is basketball injuries obviously in the NBA has been a stack
57:05
recently but looking at the profile of athletes that we're seeing these injuries in I don't know if that has
57:11
been done before in the NBA but that would be really interesting to look at
57:17
and and that would include looking at the calf and tendon complex and size.
57:23
The other thing that's really critical and I'll just bring it up now is because Nick did warn me about these questions
57:31
which is about can you prevent an Achilles rupture and I think people
57:36
do use UTC and people do use things like that to look at the structure of the tendon and get a really good idea of how
57:44
good the tissue is and that's a good indication. But we also know that
57:49
rupture is not just about pathology. What a UTC picks up is change in in
57:56
tendon integrity or structure or pathology. But what we also know is that
58:01
tendons can rupture when tendons rupture when they're weak, not just when they're
58:07
pathological. So this is a guy that I saw in the clinic who who unfortunately
58:13
was someone who I saw I was seeing for a Achilles tendon pain problem on the
58:20
other side. And so I ultrasounded both of his Achilles tendons. And then the
58:26
next week when I saw him, I was doing some hopping plyometric progressions for his painful Achilles tendon and he
58:33
ruptured his non-p painful one in the clinic when I was working with him. So
58:39
then of course I put him straight onto the bed and ultrasounds it and and this is what we saw. We saw a really fresh
58:46
Achilles tendon rupture. But this guy had an before the rupture his tendon on
58:52
ultrasound looked healthy. So that so the mantra that we have that
58:58
normal tendon does not rupture is I think based on a study that is very
59:03
biased and that was the canist study from 1997 where they had a thousand people rocking up to hospital. Of
59:10
course, they're going to be the more severe end of the spectrum, but some people w with a seemingly healthy
59:17
looking tendon will rupture. So, can you can you prevent based on imaging? I
59:22
don't think so. What you need to do is measure the stiffness of the tendon. So,
59:27
this is what we're working on now with our PhD students. We're trying to work out ways to measure how much tendon
59:35
strains for a given amount of force that you put into it. And where these measures are available and and we do
59:42
them all the time, but they're very much lab measures, but if we can use that as a screening measure in a sports context,
59:50
that would be really helpful. And that would be something that could prevent injuries if we see someone who is quite
59:58
strong and produces lots of force, but has a really compliant tendon. And
1:00:04
that's the thing that you're going to be looking for to try and intervene on that. and bring about some tendon
1:00:10
stiffness. So that's what we're working on at the moment to see if there's any preventative element to that. So that
1:00:16
could be a really good study that that that we do have an association here with the with the basketball with basketball
1:00:24
clubs here. So we're looking to try and try and run something like that once we
1:00:29
sort out these measures. But it could also be something that we do overseas as well
1:00:35
if there is interest in something like that. Yeah. So, it's hard with imaging, I
1:00:41
think, to actually know that you're preventing these these injuries, but it does give you a clue.
1:00:47
What do people use for in clubs here? In your clubs, do you use anything in terms
1:00:53
of imaging for that ability to look at the tendon and see if it's going to
1:00:58
potentially be a problem? I think a few teams utilize UTC but more
1:01:04
commonly it would just be standard ultrasound and MRI imaging of course but
1:01:10
I think a lot more teams are using ultrasound in house and then there's a bit of dabbling with eltography so what
1:01:16
would what do you guys use for that because that's the tricky thing like even our expensive cannon doesn't have the frequency to meet the stiffness of
1:01:23
these tendons. uh we do use elasttography in our in our research. So
1:01:29
we we've got a really good elasttography machine that we use. We don't have UTC
1:01:35
but we are going to we going to acquire one for this study that I'm talking
1:01:40
about. And what we want to show is we want to try and look at all the
1:01:45
different types of tendon measures because UTC basically gives you a stiffness at a specific region. So it'll
1:01:52
give you a little region of the tendon and you can see how stiff it is. It's a tough one because you have to then map
1:01:57
the tendon all the way up and down because you don't know where it's going to rupture. So I think overall strain of
1:02:04
the tendon which is what we're looking at could be an easier measure. UTC could
1:02:09
be useful. Ultrasound itself could be useful but we just don't know at this
1:02:14
point. So I think what we need to do is look at these measures and see which ones, if any, are predictive of rupture.
1:02:22
So that's yeah that's the next step. I wonder if anyone in the group here has
1:02:27
experience with any imaging pre-post rupture with any athletes or anyone have
1:02:33
experienced UTC as well.
1:02:39
Yeah I'll I'll just mention that we have used UTC's but the what you just
1:02:45
mentioned it's specific to that level. So if you're you're scanning at the free
1:02:50
tendon level, the tear can happen proximal to that and it's uncertain whether that pathology was at that the
1:02:58
site of the injury or or not. And whether that's predictive or not, it's hard to tell. But I thought Peter made a
1:03:04
good point about how the scans show the pathology, but it doesn't show the
1:03:10
capacity. And I think foundationally it's a good point to understand that tears happen when the capacity exceeds
1:03:17
or the load exceeds the capacity or they're just it's too weak. Yeah, exactly right. Yeah, couldn't
1:03:23
agree more. It's really important to differentiate those two things, especially in a sporting context where
1:03:30
you're getting a lot of high forces. So it's not just about and these players
1:03:35
are young. So, you know, they're young in inverted commas compared to the ones
1:03:41
that some of the ones I see in their 50s and 60s that rupture, they always have
1:03:46
pathology because they're of that of that age where they've built it up over
1:03:52
time anyway. Whereas these young people, they can rupture without a lot of
1:03:58
pathology there. That's my thinking. But it's yeah, it'd be really interesting to see if anyone's got pre-scans of players
1:04:06
that have ruptured. I'd be very interested in seeing those or learning more about that cuz that's what we're
1:04:12
seeing that some players don't have the real extensive pathology you might expect when they rupture.
1:04:22
I know Dr. Ali last week was very keen to do some research as well. and with any of our player data. Obviously, it
1:04:28
has to go to a upper level with the NBA, but I think we're we'd love to explore it because obviously we want to keep our
1:04:34
guys playing. So, let's keep talking. Fantastic. That'd be great. That'd be
1:04:40
really good. Yeah. Hey, Peter, I have a quick question for
1:04:45
you, sir. This is Cruz Romero with the Phoenix Suns. Hey, do you have do you have any comments on
1:04:50
surgical techniques, any pearls that you have there? And then also curious about your general thoughts on BFR throughout
1:04:57
the rehab process. Yeah, really good questions. With the first one, I don't I I don't I'm not
1:05:07
aware of any strong evidence to say this surgical technique is better than that one. There are quite a few things that
1:05:13
are looked at and obviously things that have been very well documented in the literature like speed bridges and things
1:05:19
like that but I don't there's not any strong evidence. So it does come down to
1:05:26
the surgeon their preferences and what is really going on at that point in the
1:05:31
orthopedic circles. But my my my strong thinking is that my strong hunch from
1:05:39
the experience we have with these is that if you do good rehab, it doesn't matter.
1:05:45
It probably doesn't matter. You can still get a really good outcome. And
1:05:50
always with the surgeon, we talk about just make it as tight as you can cuz if you make it tight, it's going to
1:05:58
be it's going to be a better outcome because you can always lengthen a tendon. You can't make it it's harder to
1:06:05
make it shorter. So that's what we talk about with the surgeons that we work with here as
1:06:11
something that's a good thing to aim for. What was your second qu? BFR. BFR. Yep.
1:06:16
BFR. So BFR that is it's something that
1:06:22
it could be useful in those early stages. We to be honest we don't we
1:06:28
don't use it a lot. We do use a bit of compex for some people. So we put the
1:06:35
compex on in those really early stages when they really just cannot feel their car or it's just not activating. But we
1:06:42
don't we haven't gone to BFR, but I think it could be something that is an
1:06:48
additional add-on and it could add some value in those early stages. Yeah. And
1:06:55
again, I'm not aware of any sort of research evidence looking at it, but it could be Yeah, it could be val.
1:07:01
Awesome. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Appreciate that. No worries.
1:07:10
Aside from complex, do you use any other modalities? When you say modalities, what sort of
1:07:16
things are you thinking about there? Laser, hyperaric, all of that stuff. Yeah, I would I think look, there's a
1:07:24
real strong place for recovery. Um, so if you can maximize all the basic
1:07:30
recovery elements, I think that is going to be a real positive thing. The other
1:07:36
thing I go to is collagen supplements. So definitely get them on collagen
1:07:41
supplements, but I think pretty much everyone is on collagen supplements now with any tendon problem or Achilles
1:07:47
problem. If you have access to hyperbaric laser, then why not? It's not
1:07:52
going to harm and it could be helpful. I don't see any reason not to, but it's not something that we have as part of
1:07:59
our protocol per se, but it could be an additional thing that is added on. And
1:08:04
especially with these highprofile people where it is expected, they they've got
1:08:09
24 hours a day to spend on recovering their tendon. They're going to do as much as they can. It was interesting to
1:08:16
see the documentary from Oh, I've forgotten his name now.
1:08:21
I've got a photo of him here. the New York quarterback. What's his name again? Aaron Rogers. Yeah, that documentary
1:08:28
where I think they probably did really good stuff with him, the medical team. But the documentary focused on on stuff
1:08:36
that was just peripheral to the stuff probably going to get him better, which is, as we know, the loading. And I'm
1:08:43
sure that was not the truth because it was just a documentary trying to focus on things that were a little bit
1:08:50
different or yeah, it it didn't paint a very good picture because it did focus
1:08:56
on those more peripheral things. But I think those peripheral things are fine as long as they're within the package of
1:09:02
everything you're doing.
1:09:11
Do we have any other questions?
1:09:16
I'm just going to say just quickly, my email's here. So, if there's any if there's any questions, if people have
1:09:22
any questions, just let me know. And I'm happy to share these slides by PDF with Peter Blanka.
1:09:29
Yeah, that would be great. Peter, thank you so much for your time. I know we ran a little over here, but I know everyone
1:09:36
on the call really appreciated it. It was fantastic. No problem at all. Happy to happy to
1:09:42
help and thank you again for the invitation. Yeah, we'd be happy to invite you again.
1:09:48
Yeah, no problem at all. No problem at all. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
1:09:53
Thank you so much. Thank you. All right. No problem at all. Have a good Have a good evening.
1:09:59
Thank you. And thank you, Nick. Thanks, guys. Thanks everyone. Thank you. Have a good evening.
1:10:05
Thanks for organizing. Thanks everyone. See you. Bye. Bye.
1:10:11
That was great.

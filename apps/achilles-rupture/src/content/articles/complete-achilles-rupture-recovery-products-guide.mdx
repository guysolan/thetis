## Products to Avoid

### ❌ Achilles Tendon Support Braces

**Why to avoid:** These are designed for tendinopathy, not rupture recovery. They can interfere with proper healing and are not recommended by clinical guidelines.

### ❌ Slant Boards (During Early/Mid Recovery)

**Why to avoid:** Stretching exercises on slant boards are contraindicated during the first 12 weeks of rupture recovery. They can cause re-rupture or healing in a lengthened position.

**Note:** May be used only in late rehab (weeks 12-24+) under strict clinical supervision.

### ❌ Generic Ankle Braces

**Why to avoid:** Not designed for rupture recovery and don't provide appropriate support or protection.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive guide covers all major recovery products for Achilles tendon rupture. Focus on Grade A essentials first, then add Grade B items for improved comfort and outcomes. Grade C items are optional based on your specific needs and budget.

Remember: Always consult with your healthcare provider before using any recovery equipment to ensure it's appropriate for your specific condition and recovery phase.

Recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture requires careful management and the right equipment. This guide outlines six essential items that can significantly improve your comfort, support your healing, and help you regain mobility. We'll cover everything from walking boots to shoe levelers, providing evidence-based recommendations to optimize your recovery journey.

## 1. Walking Boot Options for Achilles Rupture Recovery

The walking boot is the cornerstone of your recovery. It protects your healing tendon, allows for controlled weight-bearing, and reduces the risk of re-rupture. Two popular choices are the Aircast boot and the VACOped boot.

* **Aircast Boot:** Known for its pneumatic compression, the Aircast boot provides adjustable support and helps reduce swelling.

    > Think of the Aircast like an adjustable air cushion, providing customized support.

* **VACOped Boot:** The VACOped boot offers a vacuum cushion that conforms to the shape of your leg, providing a customized fit and excellent stability. It also allows for range-of-motion adjustments, which can be beneficial during later stages of rehabilitation.

    > Imagine the VACOped as a moldable boot, adapting perfectly to your leg's unique shape.

Medical research consistently shows that early protected weight-bearing in a suitable boot leads to better outcomes and faster recovery.

## 2. Night Splint: Protecting Your Achilles During Sleep

While a boot is best for achilles rupture recovery (see <https://achilles-rupture.com/articles/plaster-vs-boot>) - sleeping in them has problems like:

* Making the sheets dirty
* Making feet hot and sweaty
* Being uncomfortable

An alternative is to use the patented night splint from [Thetis Medical](https://thetismedical.com). It is the only splint for Achilles rupture on the market.

It is well reviewed by patients and surgeons alike and keeps the foot pointing downwards (plantar-flexed).

* **Why a Night Splint is Important:**
  * **Prevents Re-rupture:** Reduces the risk of re-injuring the tendon during sleep.
  * **Maintains Tendon Length:** Helps prevent the tendon from healing in a shortened or lengthened position.
  * **Promotes Comfort:** Enables you to safely sleep without the boot

> A night splint acts like a gentle guardian, keeping your foot in the correct position while you rest.

## 3. Elevation Aids: Reducing Swelling and Promoting Healing

Elevation is critical, especially in the early stages of recovery, to manage swelling and promote blood flow to the injured area. Keeping your leg elevated *above* heart level is key.

* **Benefits of Elevation:**
  * **Reduces Swelling:** Minimizes fluid buildup in the injured area.
  * **Improves Circulation:** Enhances blood flow, delivering essential nutrients for healing.
  * **Decreases Pain:** Reduces pressure and discomfort.

> Think of elevation as a natural way to "drain" excess fluid and boost healing.

Specialized leg elevation pillows or wedges are more effective than simply stacking pillows, as they provide consistent and correct positioning.

*Tip: If you don't want to purchase a specialized wedge, you can place a pillow under the foot end of your mattress to create a gentle incline.*

## 4. Ergonomic Crutch Handles: Preventing Secondary Injuries

If you're using crutches, ergonomic grip attachments are a worthwhile investment. Standard crutch handles can put excessive pressure on your hands and wrists, leading to discomfort, nerve compression, or even carpal tunnel syndrome.

* **Benefits of Ergonomic Handles:**
  * **Reduces Pressure:** Distributes pressure more evenly across your palms.
  * **Improves Comfort:** Makes using crutches less painful.
  * **Prevents Nerve Compression:** Reduces the risk of hand and wrist injuries.

> Ergonomic handles are like shock absorbers for your hands, making crutch use much more comfortable.

## 5. Waterproof Boot Cover: Maintaining Hygiene Safely

Keeping your walking boot and any dressings clean and dry is essential to prevent infection and skin irritation. A waterproof boot cover allows you to shower safely without getting your boot wet.

* **Why a Waterproof Cover is Essential:**
  * **Prevents Infection:** Keeps your boot and dressings dry, reducing the risk of bacterial growth.
  * **Maintains Boot Integrity:** Protects the boot from water damage.
  * **Allows for Safe Showering:** Makes showering easier and more hygienic.

> A waterproof cover acts as a shield, protecting your boot and promoting hygiene.

## 6. The EVENup Shoe Leveler: Balancing Your Gait

The EVENup Shoe Leveler is a crucial, yet often overlooked, piece of equipment for Achilles tendon rupture recovery. When you wear a walking boot, you create a significant height difference between your legs. This imbalance can lead to a cascade of problems, including:

* **Uneven Gait:** An awkward and inefficient walking pattern.
* **Back, Hip, and Knee Pain:** Increased stress on your uninjured leg and lower back.
* **Increased Risk of Falls:** Instability due to the height difference.
* **Discomfort and Fatigue:** Walking unevenly is simply tiring.

The EVENup solves this by attaching to the shoe on your *uninjured* foot, effectively leveling your hips and restoring a more natural gait.

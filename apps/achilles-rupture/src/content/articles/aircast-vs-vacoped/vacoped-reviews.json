    "content": "My Dr originally gave me an aircast with heel pads. I tried to explain that my angle wasn't really flexing down, just my toes and he brushed it off. On top of that functional shortcoming, wearing a boot not designed for heel pads was incredibly uncomfortable. I immediately did a small amount of research and found this boot that is designed for Achilles injuries. It is 10x more comfortable and actually keep your entire ankle joint in plantar flexion. Also, instead of just decreasing heel pads and keeping your ankle locked, you can set a range of motion as recovery allows. My Dr. did a little contemporary review of accelerated recovery like I did and adopted those protocols for my recovery. Is it expensive? Yeah. Is it cheap compared to everything you're going to spend on your recovery? Absolutely. On top of that, it's the only part of recovery that you are going to have to have on your leg for months so it's worth it.",

    "content": "I didn't start at the traditional flexed position of 30 degrees as per my situation. But I will say the time that I have had it, I've seen tremendous strides toward rehabbing my Achilles. The fact that you're able to simulate the movement inside the boot of walking helps wake your muscles back up, opposed to a std wedge where u just feel like like your walking on your toes. I started at a 10 degree angle after quite some time in a hard cast, and adjust the back portion for positive angle so I don't go past the 10 degree mark. I will say, if you're buying this because you think it'll be more comfortable than ur regular trauma boot. I would say you're 25% right. I don't think there will ever be a \"comfortable\" trauma boot. But it's slightly better than the traditional Air Cast style. I think advertising the sizes could be a tad better in regards to calf size. I got a medium, based on recommendation but my calf is def smaller than the boot wool allows and wouldn't Velcro shut. Ended up stitching some extra Velcro myself and problem solved, but I think the small would've been ideal if I had known. Overall I think it's a very innovative product that WILL help in your Achilles recovery. A tad pricey, but have you ever seen the price of a trauma knee braceðŸ¤¢. comparatively if you have the money, or insurance to purchase this, do it.",

    "content": "Regardless of whether you get surgery or not for a torn achilles, this boot will make your life and your rehab much better and easier. It will save you many trips back to your Orthopod to have heel lifts removed, and is worth it for that alone as you will save hours of appointmemts, waiting and driving.\n\nThe most significant benefit is it allows for full range of motion through an adjustable arc as you begin weight bearing inside the boot. With traditional heel lifts you are locked into 30Â°, 25Â°, 20Â° plantarflexed fixed positions. With this boot, you can asjust to any upper and lower position. So in the week you are cleared to go to a 5Â° lift by your doctor, you can have this boot arc between 30Â° and 5Â° range of motion. This is the difference between simulating true walking or having a club foot and your body will thank you.\n\nThere are many other benefits including the ability to swim and bathe in this boot. If you are going non-surgical when you are cleared for weight bearing in boot, you can actually shower on two feet in this boot and just buy an extra liner - after a few weeks of showering on one leg, you will be so happy. IMPORTANT: If you go surgical, get clearance from your surgeon first before wetting the area!\n\nThis boot has been available in other countries for over a decade but only in the United States since 2017. Hence, the limited number of reviews and recognition by virtually all Doctors and therapists at this time. Do not let the number of reviews or lack of general acceptance fool you. This boot will change your life. It is the best money I spent since my injury and I can recommemd it without reservation. Do your research on youtube and the companies website and you will see why. Best wishes for a full recovery.",

    "content": "I ruptured my Achilles tendon. Initially, they put on a cast, which had the advantage of being lightweight and not so bulky that I couldn't get my pants on and off. I've been pretty mobile, using both crutches, and my new favorite transportâ€”a knee scooter.\n\nI've only been using the VasoPed for one day, to replace the cast I started with. The design, overall, I think is brilliant. It's much more comfortable than the cast, and my doctor assures me that I'll heal faster with this than with a cast.\n\nOne minor gripe, and one more important one.\n\nThe minor gripe is that it's very big and heavy. So, I can't get pants on or off (even wide-legged painters pants) without taking off the boot, which my doctor said not to do. I'll have to get a zipper installed on my one pants leg. And, when I'm on crutches it's putting much more strain on my muscles keeping that leg off the ground than the lighter weight cast did.\n\nThe more important gripe is that the VasoPed system involves creating a vacuum inside the lining. To accomplish this they supply a built-in air valve. Here's the dumb part. They put the air valve right near the top in the middle, lined up with my shin. That means that there's no way to use my knee scooter without risking crushing/breaking the valve stem. Presumably, the manufacturer could have put the valve stem off to one side, instead at no additional cost. So, now, I'm forced to give up my favorite assistive device, or figure out some way to protect the valve stem so that I can use the scooter. I consider this a bad design flaw in an otherwise terrific product.",

    "content": "Obviously a thoroughly designed boot, but with a few serious issues.\n\nPros: you already know, heel wedge and ROM adjustability. Probably the swappable heel wedge is the main reason to get the boot if you need that, but adds a lot of weight and complexity.\n\nCons: sizing is ridiculously off - if you're towards the top of range your toes go on a flimsy plastic tray that bears no weight and doesn't protect your toes at all, almost 300 dollars to have your toes half an inch over the boot is insane. No refunds if you've used it so good luck learning their sizing chart the hard way.\n\n+ footbed is hard plastic with no padding\n+ liner offers little padding â€” it's basically a bunch of massage balls pulled by a partial vacuum. The balls move and bunch up which can injure your feet as you'll have a lot of little balls and in some none (Eg your heel as your weight moves the balls). Apparently you can smooth this out your foot is already sore at this point. I am sure some people manage this issue very effectively, but I don't understand why you would want this over padding.\n\n+ heavier and bulkier than other boots.\n\nNo refunds if you've used it so there's that.",

    "content": "I'm currently still in this boot. My rehab is going faster than expected. I was able to walk full-weight bearing without crutches 28 days post-op.

I went to Hawaii the next day after being able to be full weight bearing, and in Hawaii I was able to walk without a crutch on average 7-8 miles per day. I was exhausted at the end of the day everyday we were there, but I was able to walk and get around. It does take a lot more energy walking with this boot (it takes a lot of energy walking in any kind of boot). Walking on sand, is almost impossible though, it takes way too much energy and your other leg starts to almost die out. This boot is specifically made for achilles ruptures. It keeps your foot safe from re-injuring it. I felt safe walking around everywhere with this boot. Just listen to your body and don't push it harder than it should.",

Surgeon anticipates I will be able to transition to a shoe with heel lifts at the 10 week mark. Overall, this device has aided in m recovery.\n\nDESIGN ISSUE: The air-valve for this device sits at the top of my shin, about 5-6 inches below my knee. I have to use the mobility cart to get around for work (Knee Rover), and the air valve is positioned exactly where my leg sits on the cart cushion. This is extremely uncomfortable and leaves bruises in that area. Developers/designers need to consider moving the valve to the side of the device so that both items can comfortably be used together.\n\nCOST: This device is really sturdy, but I don't believe it is $300 worth of sturdy.

First is the liner, which may not require the vacuum pump again, but it might. THEN getting the lined foot into the boot frame, THEN putting the front cage around the liner and installed correctly, THEN strapped correctly so as not to pinch the liner valve. Finally the boot is on. Sheesh. Difficulty if you are not young and flexible, I have to do it sitting on a the top of the stairs.\nBut I would buy it again. It does what it is supposed to do.

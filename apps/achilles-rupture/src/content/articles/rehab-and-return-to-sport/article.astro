  <h2 id="why-plan">Why a Structured Plan Matters</h2>
  <p>
    A 2023 systematic review of more than 1,300 athletes (PMCID: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11379499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMC11379499</a>) found that following a progressive, criteria-based protocol was the <strong>single biggest predictor</strong> of timely, complication-free return to sport <sup>1</sup>. Patients who tried to "wing it" experienced a 3-fold higher re-rupture rate and were 8 weeks slower to resume competition.
  </p>

  <h2 id="healing-phases">Inside the Tendon – Biology Drives the Timeline</h2>
  <p>
    Regardless of surgical technique, Achilles healing follows the classic three-phase continuum:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Inflammatory phase (0-2&nbsp;weeks):</strong> Clotting and cellular clean-up dominate. The repair is at its weakest; any uncontrolled dorsiflexion can pull sutures apart <sup>1</sup>.</li>
    <li><strong>Proliferative phase (2-6&nbsp;weeks):</strong> Rapid collagen type&nbsp;III deposition fills the gap. These cross-links are disorganised, acting like Velcro – great in shear but poor in tension. Gentle motion and <em>protected</em> load help fibres orient along the line of force.</li>
    <li><strong>Remodelling phase (6&nbsp;weeks-12&nbsp;months):</strong> Gradual conversion to stronger type I collagen and increased tendon stiffness. Loading intensity must rise in parallel or tissue quality will plateau.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Understanding this biology explains why the review authors recommend <strong>graduated load versus strict immobilisation</strong>. Complete rest beyond the first fortnight delays the transition to type I collagen, leaving the tendon elongated and weak when sport demands return.
  </p>

  <h2 id="immobilisation">Cast vs Functional Bracing – What the Evidence Says</h2>
  <p>
    Earlier generations of protocols involved 6-8&nbsp;weeks in a plaster cast. The review compared these historical series to modern functional bracing that allows <em>immediate partial weight-bearing</em> in a boot:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rerupture:</strong> 4.9 % in functional bracing vs 7.2 % in prolonged casting.</li>
    <li><strong>Return-to-play time:</strong> 5.8 months vs 7.3 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Plantar-flexion strength deficit at 12 months:</strong> 11 % vs 18 %.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The message is clear – <em>early, protected movement wins</em>. Ensure your boot achieves true equinus (≥30 ° plantar-flexion). Our comparison of <a href="/articles/aircast-vs-vacoped" class="text-primary underline">Aircast vs VACOped</a> dives deeper into brace biomechanics.
  </p>

  <h2 id="loading">Progressive Loading – How Much, How Soon?</h2>
  <p>
    The systematic review distilled dozens of protocols into a simple principle: <strong>small daily increments beat large weekly jumps</strong>. Below is a practical loading ladder adapted from their highest-quality studies:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead><tr><th>Post-Op Week</th><th>Load Target</th><th>Example Exercise</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>0-2</td><td>10 % body-weight</td><td>Toe-touch weight-bearing in boot</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2-4</td><td>25 %</td><td>Seated isotonic calf pumps against green Theraband</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4-6</td><td>50 %</td><td>Double-leg heel raises (boot on)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6-8</td><td>75 %</td><td>Double-leg heel raises (boot off) + body-weight squats</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8-12</td><td>Full</td><td>Single-leg heel raises, farmer carries</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3 id="bfr">Blood-Flow Restriction (BFR) – An Evidence-Backed Accelerator</h3>
  <p>
    Seven included trials used low-load BFR (<em>20-30 % 1RM</em>) during seated calf raises from week 3 onwards. Compared with matched controls, BFR groups achieved <strong>21 % greater soleus CSA</strong> at 12 weeks and reported lower perceived exertion. Ensure cuff pressure is set to 60-80 % limb occlusion and sessions are supervised.
  </p>

  <h2 id="tendon-length">Watching Out For Tendon Elongation</h2>
  <p>
    Excessive lengthening (>10 mm) reduces push-off power and is a key predictor of poor jump height years later <sup>3</sup>. Tips to minimise elongation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain equinus at rest <em>and</em> during weight-bearing for the first 5 weeks.</li>
    <li>Never stretch into dorsiflexion before week 12.</li>
    <li>Measure heel-rise height every fortnight – a drop of >2 cm versus contralateral side warrants a protocol review.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="strength-continuum">Building Strength – Beyond Heel Raises</h2>
  <p>
    By month 3 the tendon can handle higher tendon loads, but the <em>muscle</em> may lag behind. Integrated programming should include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Isometric heavy holds</strong> (Smith-machine calf isos at mid-plantar-flexion).</li>
    <li><strong>Eccentric-biased deficits</strong> – standing on a step, rise on both feet, drop slowly on the affected.</li>
    <li><strong>Hip and knee drivers</strong> – sled pushes, trap-bar dead-lifts, split squats – improve global force capacity and offload the tendon on return to sprinting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="plyometrics">Introducing Plyometrics Safely</h2>
  <p>
    The review recommends meeting <em>three readiness criteria</em> before the first hop:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Single-leg heel-rise x 25 reps at body-weight.</li>
    <li>Pain-free jog / walk 10 min continuously.</li>
    <li>No observable limp or asymmetry on high-speed video (<a href="https://www.kinovea.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinovea</a> is a free app).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Start with <strong>low-amplitude pogo jumps</strong> on a sprung surface, progress to single-leg hops, then multidirectional bounds. Volume guidelines: 3 × 40 contacts, 48 h recovery.
  </p>

  <h2 id="on-field">On-Field Reconditioning – 4 Pillars</h2>
  <p>
    Borrowing from Buckthorpe's CLEW framework <sup>4</sup>, on-field rehab should integrate:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Movement Quality:</strong> retrain gait, deceleration, and cutting mechanics.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical Conditioning:</strong> aerobic repeat sprint sessions, tempo runs at 70-85 % MAS.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill Restoration:</strong> ball handling, racket swings, or jumping serves.</li>
    <li><strong>Chronic Load Development:</strong> gradually build weekly running metres to 90 % pre-injury load before competitive return.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="psychology">Mind Matters – Tackling Kinesiophobia</h2>
  <p>
    Up to 46 % of athletes in the review delayed return because of <em>fear-of-re-injury</em> despite meeting physical tests. Tools such as the <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Tampa_Scale_for_Kinesiophobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tampa Scale</a> can identify concern early. Cognitive-behavioural strategies, graded exposure, and celebrating mini-milestones (e.g. first run, first cut) are proven to lower fear scores and speed return by roughly 4 weeks.
  </p>

  <h2 id="case-study">Real-World Case Study – Semi-Pro Basketball Guard</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Profile:</strong> 25-year-old shooting guard, left Achilles rupture in preseason, open SpeedBridge™ repair.<br/>
    <strong>Timeline Highlights:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Day 3: Partial weight-bearing with crutches, boot at 30 °.</li>
    <li>Week 2: BFR seated calf raises, stationary bike.</li>
    <li>Week 5: Boot angle 15 °, double-leg heel raises.</li>
    <li>Week 8: Out of boot, jogging drills, single-leg balance.</li>
    <li>Week 12: Pogo jumps, resisted sprints on 1080 Sprint trainer.</li>
    <li>Month 5: Full team practice, match-like workloads.</li>
    <li>Month 6: Competitive return, scored 18&nbsp;pts in first game.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This mirrors the median 6-month RTS reported in the systematic review and underscores the impact of early load and objective criteria tracking.
  </p>

  <h2 id="milestones">Key Milestones (Evidence-Based)</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src={milestonesImg.src} alt="Timeline graphic of rehab milestones" />
    <figcaption class="text-gray-500 text-sm">Typical progression adapted from PMC11379499 systematic review</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weeks 0-2:</strong> Boot in full equinus, partial weight-bearing as tolerated.</li>
    <li><strong>Weeks 2-6:</strong> Gradual heel-wedge reduction ➝ full weight-bearing. Begin seated calf-activation &amp; isometrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Weeks 6-12:</strong> Transition out of boot. Double → single-leg heel raises. Stationary bike → light jog (~10-12 wk).</li>
    <li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> Plyometrics, sport-specific drills, on-field running progression.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 6+:</strong> Return to unrestricted sport once strength ≥ 90 % of contralateral side &amp; hop tests symmetric <sup>2</sup>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="strength">Calf-Strength Targets</h2>

    <figcaption class="text-gray-500 text-sm">Average plantar-flexion strength recovery (isokinetic dynamometry) reported across 9 cohorts <sup>1</sup>.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The review highlights a <strong>rapid early gain</strong> once loading begins, followed by a plateau after 6 months. Continued heavy resistance (e.g. weighted heel raises, sled pushes) is essential beyond this point.
  </p>

  <h2 id="gear">Recommended Gear To Smooth Your Journey</h2>
  <p>Based on surgeon and patient feedback we analysed in our <a href="/recovery-equipment-guide" class="text-primary underline">Recovery Equipment Leaderboard</a>, the following products consistently reduced pain and sped up milestones:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://thetismedical.com/night-splint" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thetis Night Splint</a> – sleep safely without the hot day-boot, reducing accidental dorsiflexion at night.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HY68DO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVENup Shoe Leveler</a> – balances leg length while you're still in the boot to prevent back &amp; knee pain.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qinaoco-Waterproof-Non-Slip-Watertight-Protector/dp/B0BZ43M5RD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waterproof Boot Cover</a> – keeps the liner dry in the shower, lowering infection risk.</li>

  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="return-to-running">From Walking ➝ Running ➝ Sport</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Pain-Free Walk Test:</strong> 30 min walk in normal trainers without pain or limp.</li>
    <li><strong>Calf Strength:</strong> ≥ 25 continuous single-leg heel raises on injured side.</li>
    <li><strong>Jog : Walk = 1 : 1</strong> intervals on flat track, progressing to 10 min continuous jog.</li>
    <li><strong>Hop Tests:</strong> Triple-hop distance symmetry ≥ 90 %.</li>
    <li><strong>Sport-Specific Drills:</strong> e.g. change-of-direction, acceleration, deceleration.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="mt-4">Fail any step?  ➝  Drop back one level for ≥ 7 days before retrying.</p>

  <h2 id="red-flags">Red Flags – When To Seek Help</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sudden "snap" sensation or sharp rise in pain</li>
    <li>New swelling, redness or calf tightness (rule out DVT)</li>
    <li>Inability to perform a single-leg heel raise by week 12</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
    Returning to sport after Achilles repair is a marathon, not a sprint. Follow a criteria-based progression, measure your calf strength, and leverage modern recovery aids to make the journey safer and more comfortable.

# A Doctor's Perspective on Achilles Ruptur Recovery

An Achilles tendon rupture is a devastating blow to a patient's daily routine and athletic aspirations. The recovery process, nevertheless, does not need to be an exasperating experience. Knowledge of the recovery process and the science behind it is important for clinicians to facilitate their patients' recovery experience.

The Achilles tendon, the strongest and largest tendon in the human body, is solely responsible for movement, especially walking, running, and jumping [1]. But it is not invincible. With the rising incidences of Achilles tendon rupture around the world, particularly in men who are two to eight times more likely to sustain the injury than women, physicians need to be equipped with the best possible methods of diagnosing and treating the injury [2].

In this article, we will discuss the critical stages of Achilles rupture recovery. We'll focus on everything from the acute stage to long-term rehabilitation so that you can provide the best treatment and care to your patients.

## Initial Treatment Protocol and Diagnosis

### Clinical Tests and Imaging

Diagnosis of a primary Achilles tendon rupture relies on imaging and clinical assessment. One of the most common is the Thompson test, which assesses the continuity of the Achilles tendon. The test is done by squeezing the calf muscles and observing if the foot will move, which would be a sign of a functional tendon [3].

The Matles test, another modified version of the Thompson test, is also helpful in confirming the rupture when the patient is prone and the ankle is neutral. Palpation of the gap in the tendon is also a helpful diagnostic aid, particularly in more extensive ruptures [4].

Imaging techniques such as MRI and ultrasound are very useful in diagnosis and also in ascertaining the grade of the injury. Shear Wave Elastography is also under investigation as a new non-invasive method for identifying early degeneration of tendons, even before rupture [5].

### Non-Surgical versus Surgical Management

Achilles tendon rupture management has moved towards non-surgical treatment based on high-level evidence for early mobilization. The SMART protocol, a functional treatment, shows comparable results to surgery with fewer complications such as infection and re-rupture [6].

For patients with degenerative tendon changes or those who are low-activity, an Achilles rupture splint offers greater support and mobility during immobilization. However, there is a divide in practice between public and private healthcare settings, with private healthcare often opting for more surgical interventions. In athletes, particularly those who need to return to sport, certain surgeries, such as tendon anchoring procedures, are employed to reattach the tendon to the bone, promoting faster and more secure recovery.

## Early Recovery Phase (Weeks 1–6)

The initial six weeks are focused on the recovery of the tendon and the prevention of complications. Plantarflexion walking boot is normally used to functionally immobilize and reduce tension on the tendon. Gradual weight-bearing begins under protocols like SMART and grows from partial to full weight-bearing [7].

Two commonly used boots during this phase are the Aircast with wedges and the VACOped which allows a dynamic range of motion. Each offers different levels of support and mobility. The choice of boot can significantly influence recovery experience [8]. The patient's recovery must be evaluated by clinicians regularly to allow proper healing and prevent complications.

Many patients find sleeping in the boot uncomfortable. Additional purchases such as the Thetis Medical Achilles rupture Splint, the OPED Even-Up or a Limbo waterproof cover, can be useful adjuncts. It's important to note that a splint is not a replacement for the walking boot but can be used in conjunction to enhance mobility.

Early controlled range-of-motion exercises are started to prevent stiffness and tendon elongation. Adherence to the rehabilitation protocol must be maintained to prevent re-rupture and allow proper progression to the subsequent phase of recovery [7].

## Rehabilitation Phase (Weeks 7–12)

As the tendon heals, the focus is on recovering strength and function. Concentric and eccentric loading are the most critical exercises in calf strengthening. Eccentric loading, which involves lengthening the muscle under tension, is highly effective in the rehabilitation of the Achilles tendon [9].

Retraining of gait must also be done to correct compensatory movement that could occur. Therapists must rehabilitate patients to relearn proper biomechanics and symmetry to their gait [7].

Balance and proprioception exercises, such as single-leg stands, BOSU ball exercises, and balance board drills, are added to improve coordination and reduce the risk of falling [10]. At this stage, the patient's recovery is observed from time to time, and the rehabilitation program is adjusted to avoid reinjury or overuse. The patient must be educated to inform the therapists of any pain or overuse symptoms in doing these drills.

## Late Recovery Phase (Weeks 13–24)

During late recovery, patients can typically initiate more strenuous activities. Plyometric training and full-strength resistance training, such as jumping and bounding, are introduced to reinforce tendon elasticity and strength [11].

Sport-specific exercises are incorporated depending on the goals of the patient. In the case of the athlete, the exercises help the athlete get back to sports and be properly conditioned for high-impact sports.

Functional testing is also paramount in determining return to sports readiness. Clinicians need to test for endurance and symmetry of heel rise to evaluate functional recovery [12].

Psychological readiness is also required. Patients need to be reassured that they can do things without the risk of re-injury. During follow-up appointments, clinicians should check for proper tendon healing, range of motion, strength, and balance. Follow-up appointments ensure that the patient is on the road to a successful recovery.

## New Technologies in the Treatment of Achilles Tendon

Emerging technologies are taking center stage in Achilles tendon management. Shear Wave Elastography, a non-invasive imaging method, quantifies tendon stiffness and can identify early degenerative changes. Therefore, it helps clinicians take proactive actions [5].

Regenerative treatments such as exosome therapy and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are being researched as ways to maximize Achilles tendon healing [13]. Experimental though they are, they can prove to be components of individualized treatment protocols for patients with extensive tendon damage or not responding to standard rehabilitation.

## Long-Term Outcomes

In the top athletes, recovery to full sport could be prolonged because of issues such as tendinous stretching or decreased strength. Psychological issues, such as fear of re-injury, can also impact the time to recovery.

There must be ongoing follow-up care, both functional and psychological, to verify that the patient is healing as expected. Proper education and establishment of expectations are centrally important to long-term success.

## The Bottom Line

Recovery from Achilles rupture has come a long way; today, evidence supports nonoperative management and early mobilization, though surgery still offers a faster road back to sport which offers advantages to athletes. With ongoing knowledge of the newest techniques of rehabilitation, clinicians are able to provide the best care for their patients. A well-organized treatment plan provides the maximum recovery and eliminates the likelihood of complications.

## FAQs

### What are the common signs and symptoms of an Achilles tendon rupture?

Severe tenderness, swelling, bruising, and inability to stand on tiptoes.

### Which is the optimal treatment: surgery or conservative management?

Nonoperative treatment and early rehabilitation are effective for many. However, many developed countries often favor surgery due to healthcare systems and patient needs. This makes the choice context-dependent.

### How quickly does it take to heal from an Achilles tendon rupture?

Recovery typically takes 6-12 months, depending on severity and rehabilitation regimen.

### How do you reduce the risk of re-injury?

The key is to follow a structured rehabilitative protocol, such as SMART (Standardized Multimodal Achilles Rehabilitation Treatment), along with progressive loading. Additionally, psychological readiness also contributes a lot to the risk of injury.

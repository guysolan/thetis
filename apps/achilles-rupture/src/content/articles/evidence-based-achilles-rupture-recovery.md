## Surgery is not always required for Achilles Tendon Rupture

Patients with a ruptured Achilles tendon are often surprised to hear that they do not require an operation to repair it. Natural healing is, in fact, extremely reliable. Treatment in a boot with “functional rehabilitation” gives excellent results. Surgical treatment is not required except in certain circumstances. Surgery always carries more risks than non-surgical treatment.
This scientific paper from the UK was published in 2015. It remains the best evidence for how an Achilles tendon rupture should be treated.

## Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) for fast and reliable Achilles Rupture Recovery? Not yet

Patients want the fastest and most reliable recovery.
Newspapers and the internet frequently write about using biological therapies to treat orthopaedic injuries. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a treatment where the patient’s own blood is taken from an arm vein, spun to concentrate the healing potential and injected back into the injured/painful part. This is a promising idea and has been tried in many parts of the body. Unfortunately there is no reliable evidence that it is useful.
Thetis surgeons were involved with the PATH-2 study investigating the use of PRP in Achilles’ tendon ruptures. The results demonstrate no benefit with the use of PRP. The 2 year data has recently been published reinforcing the conclusion that enhancing healing with PRP is not yet a reality.

        question: "Why is the Thetis Night Splint rated #1?",
        answer: "It's the only night splint specifically designed for Achilles rupture recovery, addressing a critical gap in the market. Traditional boots are uncomfortable for sleep, leading to poor rest and potential re-injury risks. The Thetis splint has received endorsements from leading surgeons including the Past President of the British Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (BOFAS), the UK's leading authority on foot and ankle surgery. Patients consistently report it's \"worth every penny\" and call it a \"game changer\" despite the premium price, praising the quality made in England design."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need all these items?",
        answer: "The walking boot and crutches are essential - you cannot recover without them. The night splint is highly recommended by both surgeons and patients for sleep comfort and preventing re-rupture during vulnerable sleep movements. Other items significantly improve quality of life during recovery but aren't strictly necessary. We recommend starting with the essentials and adding comfort items as you identify specific needs."
    },
    {
        question: "When should I buy these items?",
        answer: "Ideally, have the essential items ready as soon as possible after injury. As one patient said: \"I wish I'd gotten everything from the start. Adding items piecemeal as problems arose was frustrating and more expensive in the long run.\" The night splint becomes crucial once you start needing better sleep (usually within the first week). Other comfort items can be added as needed throughout your recovery journey."
    },
    {
        question: "Is the Thetis Night Splint worth the higher price?",
        answer: "Patient reviews consistently say yes. One patient wrote: \"This has been a very worthwhile purchase. It's a good example of a small company that's identified a problem and provided a solution... worth every penny.\" Another said \"It was fantastic being able to remove the boot and sleep comfortably.\" The splint is quality made in England with a patented design, and it's the only night splint specifically engineered for Achilles rupture recovery. Many patients report it's a \"game changer\" for getting proper sleep during recovery."
    },
    {
        question: "How long will I need these items?",
        answer: "Boot usage typically lasts 6-12 weeks depending on your treatment protocol. The night splint is useful throughout the immobilization phase and early rehabilitation. As Brandon (USA) noted: \"This worked great and kept me from having to wear my big clunky walking boot to bed!\" Items like the EVENup and crutch handles are needed as long as you're using crutches or the boot."
    },
    {
        question: "What do surgeons say about these recommendations?",
        answer: "Leading foot and ankle surgeons strongly support proper equipment. Dr. Robbie Ray states he has \"found the Thetis splint particularly effective in bridging the gap between immobilization and active recovery.\" Mr. James Davis (Past President of BOFAS) specifically endorses the Thetis splint: \"When I tore my own Achilles tendon, the hardest part of the recovery was having to wear the hospital boot in bed at night for many weeks. It is fantastic that Thetis Medical have produced this night-splint. It is certain to improve the recovery experience for patients.\""

# Orders

## Order Form

- Consumed Components
- Order Items

If ordering a product the purchase order should only show what is paid for. So if manufacturing a product, I pay for the service of manufacturing, this shows on the purchase order.

However, the total parts stored should be decreased, as well as the number of products stored increased (if it's a product so uses parts to make it).

Products, services and parts are all items.

I have order items, which are items that are part of an order.

To keep track of what is going on how should I like items to orders to only show the items being paid for to the manufacturer but maintain visibility of the stock levels for inventory tracking?

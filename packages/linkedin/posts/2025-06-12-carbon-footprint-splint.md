🌱 We moved from boxes to bags for our Achilles Rupture Splints—here are the results (Q2 2024).

Why this matters for North America:

- Moved from boxes to bags: 2x more space efficient
- 2000 units = 80 boxes → now just 40 bags
- Fewer shipments = lower shipping costs for our customers
- Reduced air freight = smaller carbon footprint
- More budget for UK manufacturing, less for shipping

We'd rather invest in UK manufacturing than pay to ship air around the world.

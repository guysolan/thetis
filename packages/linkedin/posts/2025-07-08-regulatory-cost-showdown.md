ðŸ’¸ **Same splint, two rule books, very different invoices.**

| Badge | Up-front fees | Typical timeline |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **UKCA + MHRA** | **Â£110** filing + Â£0 annual | ~30 days |
| ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **FDA 510(k)** | **$10 400** incl. $2 000 Registrar Corp admin | 9â€“11 months |

Add lab testing, legal, consultant hoursâ€¦ and the FDA route is easily **50Ã—** the cost.

Why bother?

1. Patients everywhere deserve comfy nights ðŸ’¤
2. US surgeons askedâ€”loudly ðŸ“¢
3. Big markets fund better R&D ðŸ”¬

Founders: which market would *you* tackle first? ðŸ”½

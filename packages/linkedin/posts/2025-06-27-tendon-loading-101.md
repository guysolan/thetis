Tendon ≠ rope; it's living tissue.

Load parameters (EFORT Open Rev 2022 meta-analysis):
- **Magnitude** – 80–100 % body-weight for strength gains
- **Duration** – 2–3 s concentric/eccentric
- **Frequency** – 5×/week

Under-load → scarred tissue 💤
Over-load → re-rupture ⚠️

Find the sweet spot—your patients' calves will thank you.

# Pro Athletes After Achilles Rupture – Who Comes Back? 🏆

Major-league study of **80 NBA/NFL/MLS/NHL players** post-surgery (Trofa et al. AJSM 2017):

• Overall **80 %** returned to play ✅  
• Mean time to first game: **10.5 months** ⏱️  
• BUT 36 % started <10 games the rest of their career ⚠️  
• Player Efficiency Rating dropped **-2.9 pts** on average 📉  
• 21 % retired because of the injury 🚪

Performance, not just participation, matters – rehab & load-management are the competitive edge.

ðŸš€ 78% of our website traffic comes from our in-depth guides on Achilles rupture recovery.

These guides donâ€™t just informâ€”they drive both product awareness and sales for the Achilles rupture splint.

Why do these articles rank so well on Google?  
Theyâ€™re detailed, highly niche, and answer the real questions patients and clinicians are searching for.

If youâ€™re a clinician, you already have this kind of expertise. Sharing it online can help grow your practice and reputation.

Tips for clinicians:

- Write a few comprehensive articles on topics you know inside out.
- Use local statistics (like incidence rates from your own audits) to attract visitors who are nearbyâ€”and more likely to become patients.
- Aim for 1,500 words per article, and include a FAQ section at the end.
- Be patient: it can take 12â€“18 months for organic traffic to build, but the results are worth it.

If you run a medical device business, invite clinicians to contribute articles. Their insights can drive high-quality, relevant traffic to your siteâ€”and boost your credibility.

Content is still king in healthcare. Start today, and your future patients will thank you.

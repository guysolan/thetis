Do you know about Dynamic Hinge Systems for Achilles Tendon Rupture?

Recent research has shown that functional rehabilitation with early weightbearing is a safe alternative to traditional plaster cast treatment following an Achilles tendon rupture, with better early functional outcomes (Mampal et al., 2020).

The key difference between VACOped and Aircast isn't just about hinges vs. wedges - it's about dynamic range of motion versus fixed positions.

Both boots aim to hold the ruptured tendon ends together for optimal healing, but they achieve this differently:

VACOped: Uses a hinged mechanism allowing controlled movement within a safe range
Aircast: Uses fixed wedges to maintain specific angles

Research by Ellison et al. (2017) found:

- Traditional Cast: 56° ankle plantarflexion
- VACOped: 48° ankle plantarflexion
- Aircast: 28° ankle plantarflexion (with midfoot compensation)

The critical phase comes after 4-5 weeks when patients need to gradually decrease plantarflexion:

VACOped's Dynamic ROM:

- 20-30° (weeks 5-7)
- 10-30° (weeks 7-9)
- 0-30° (weeks 9-11)

Aircast's Fixed Positions:

- 28° (weeks 0-5)
- 22° (weeks 5-7)
- 16° (weeks 7-9)
- 8° (weeks 9-11)

The theory suggests that VACOped's dynamic movement may:

- Reduce muscle wasting
- Maintain better muscle activity
- Provide more natural walking patterns
- Reduce tendon loading by up to 30% during ambulation

What's your experience with these boots? Do you see a difference in patient outcomes with dynamic vs. fixed ROM?

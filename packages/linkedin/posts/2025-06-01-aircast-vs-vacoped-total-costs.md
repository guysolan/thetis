💰 The Hidden Cost of Achilles Rupture Recovery: Aircast vs VACOped

Foot and Ankle surgeons are often asked: "Is the VACOped worth the extra cost?"

Let's break down what patients REALLY need for a complete recovery setup:

👢 Aircast System ($298 total):

- Boot: $150
- Wedges: $25
- Waterproof Cover: $30
- Night Splint: $93

🦿 VACOped System ($544 total):

- Boot: $375
- Replacement Liner: $40
- EVENup Shoe Leveler: $36
- Night Splint: $93

That's a $246 difference! 💸

The key difference? VACOped's Dynamic ROM vs Aircast's Fixed Positions:

📊 VACOped's Dynamic ROM:

- 20-30° (weeks 5-7)
- 10-30° (weeks 7-9)
- 0-30° (weeks 9-11)

📏 Aircast's Fixed Positions:

- 28° (weeks 0-5)
- 22° (weeks 5-7)
- 16° (weeks 7-9)
- 8° (weeks 9-11)

The theory is compelling:

- Reduced muscle wasting 💪
- More natural gait patterns 🚶‍♂️
- Lower tendon loading ⚖️
- Gradual ROM progression 📈

But here's what I tell my patients:

1. Both boots achieve the same end goal 🎯
2. Both support early weightbearing 🦵
3. Both need proper patient education 📚
4. Both require adjunctive products 🛠️

The real question isn't about the boot - it's about the patient:

- Active lifestyle? VACOped might be worth it 🏃‍♂️
- Budget conscious? Aircast works well 💰
- Need waterproofing? VACOped has the edge 💧
- Want simplicity? Aircast is easier to use ✨

What's your experience? Do you see enough clinical benefit to justify the price difference?

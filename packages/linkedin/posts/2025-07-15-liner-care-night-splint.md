🍃 Fresh liner = fresh healing.

Best practices (IFU v3.2):
1. Swap every **7–10 days**
2. Hand-wash at 30 °C with pH-neutral soap 🧼
3. Air-dry; avoid tumble heat 🔥
4. UV-C cabinet? 5-min cycle achieves **>99.9 % bacterial kill** (J Hosp Infection 2022)

Clinics: do you resale spare liners or bundle them into the kit?

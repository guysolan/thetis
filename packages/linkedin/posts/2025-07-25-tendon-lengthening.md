# Every Millimeter Counts – Tendon Elongation After Rupture 📏

Longer isn't better when it comes to tendons.

MRI Follow-Up Study:

• Elongation at 12 months: 4.8 mm (non-operative) vs 2.5 mm (operative) 🧵  
• Each extra mm ↗️ led to 2 % ↓ in plantar-flexion strength 🦶  
• Patients with ≥5 mm elongation were 3× more likely to report fatigue 💤  
• No correlation with calf circumference 🧐  

Do you measure tendon length in your follow-ups?

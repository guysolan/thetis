🛠️ Some patients (and even surgeons!) try to MacGyver a night brace from plaster & Velcro.

👨‍⚕️ **Mr James Davis** – past President, British Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society – did exactly that after *his* rupture:

> “My only option was to make myself a splint using plaster-cast materials… It is fantastic that Thetis have produced this night-splint. It is certain to improve the recovery experience.” (clinicians.ts)

Cost breakdown 💷
| Solution | Up-front cost | ISO testing | Patient comfort |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| DIY plaster + straps | ~£48 materials + 3 h labour | ❌ | 😖 |
| Thetis Splint | £93 | ✅ Class I MDR-compliant | 😴 |

Sometimes cheap is *expensive*.

Surgeons: still recommending the bucket of plaster? 🪣

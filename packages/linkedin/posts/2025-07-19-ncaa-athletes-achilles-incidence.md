# Achilles Ruptures in NCAA Athletes – How Often & Where?

Just **2.17 injuries per 100,000 athlete-exposures** across ALL college sports – but some teams are real hot-spots!

Top Sports (2004-2014 NCAA-ISP):

• Women’s Gymnastics: 16.7 /100k AEs 🤸‍♀️  
• Men’s Basketball: 4.3 /100k AEs 🏀  
• Women’s Basketball: 3.3 /100k AEs 🏀  
• 20 % of all injuries were SEVERE (median 48-day time-loss) ⏱️  
• 65 % of severe cases went to surgery 🩺

Jump-heavy sports flip the script: Achilles ruptures, typically a 5:1 male-to-female injury, strike collegiate women gymnasts at **astonishingly high** rates. Younger athletes in low-impact sports stay relatively safe — it's the repeated take-offs and landings that load the tendon to its limits.

Which college athletic trainers in your network need a few Achilles-rupture splints on the sidelines?

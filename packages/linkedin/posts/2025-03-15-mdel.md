I spend 8 hours being inspected by the Canadian Government last week, believe it or not, it was actually fun.

Class I Medical devices need to be registered with the Medical Device Establishment in Canada. Thetis Medical had our first inspection ðŸ”¬ last week.

They essentially wanted to know if we could get a manufacturing batch back in case there was a defect. ðŸ§¨

8 hours later, they seem to believe we could... (ðŸ¥³?)

Welcome to the world of hashtag#MedTech. Lots of paperwork but, thanks to some help from AI, not enough to drown me.

Strapping a boot at **45° PF** feels safe—until it isn't.

📄 *Brumann M et al., Injury 2014* showed:
- **+3 weeks** delay in regaining neutral dorsiflexion vs. 20–30° protocols (n = 96)
- ↑ calf atrophy (Δ CSA −18 %) 

Risks:
- Gastrocnemius shortening ⚠️
- Awkward gait → hip & knee overload
- Harder transition to shoes

Optimal range? **20–30°** for immobilisation; unlock ROM by Week 3.

How steep are *your* orders?

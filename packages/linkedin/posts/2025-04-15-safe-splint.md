Not all surgeons allow their patients to recover comfortably...

Some surgeons are understandably apprehensive about allowing their patients to use the Achilles rupture splint as an alternative to the boot during recovery.

Re-ruptures are serious complications, and their caution is understandable.

BUT, Thetis Medical has now had over 3,000 patients use the splint without a single complication.

Hopefully this gives foot and ankle surgeons the peace of mind that patients can sleep without a boot if, and only if, they wear a splint.

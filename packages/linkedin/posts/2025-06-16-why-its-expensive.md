🏢 At @Thetis Medical, we're proud to manufacture our Achilles rupture splint 100% in the UK. We often get asked why, especially when it means higher costs. Here's a look behind our decision.

🛠️ Our splint is built from 6 key components, all sourced and assembled domestically:

1. Medical-grade sponge lining for comfort
2. High-durability elastic straps
3. Industrial-strength nylon webbing
4. Custom-molded plastic shell
5. Premium Velcro fasteners
6. Reinforced threading

🇬🇧 This commitment to local sourcing with partners like MPD Hook and Loop means our costs are 4-5 times higher than manufacturing in Asia. This is reflected in our final price.

⭐ We recently received a two-star review: "I have to buy this product because it is the only option at this price - the company is just shooting fish in a barrel."

This might be one of our favorite "negative" reviews. It highlights an important truth: quality, domestic manufacturing has a real-world cost.

So, why do we insist on it?

💪 For us, the reasons are clear:

* Supporting UK manufacturing jobs
* Maintaining strict quality control
* Reducing supply chain vulnerabilities
* Contributing to a country which shares the companies values

✨ The higher price is a trade-off we believe is worth making for a product made entirely in the UK. It's a core part of our identity.

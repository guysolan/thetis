One thing I agree with Trump on - onshoring manufacturing

My company @Thetis Medical makes our Achilles rupture splint 100% in the UK.

The splint is made from 6 things:

1. Sponge lining
2. Elastic straps
3. Nylon Webbing
4. Plastic Shell
5. Velcro
6. Thread

All from the UK, all assembled in the UK by the phenomenal MPD Hook and Loop.

This means that making the product costs 4 or 5 times what it would cost in Asia

It also means, we have to sell the product at a high price.

One Amazon review we got from a nurse told us "I have to buy this product because it is the only option at this price the company is just shooting fish in a barrel".

Probably my favorite negative review to date. Two stars. Fair enough.

But, giving 50% of our annual profit a UK based company is, for me, worth the price of a few ignorant grumbles.

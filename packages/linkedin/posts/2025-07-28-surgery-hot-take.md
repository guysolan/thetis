🔍 **The Achilles Rupture Treatment Gap: What Our Research Reveals**

At Thetis Medical, we've been investigating a concerning trend in Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) treatment protocols worldwide.

Our research has uncovered a significant dichotomy in patient management approaches:

**Private Healthcare Systems** → Higher surgical intervention rates
**Public Healthcare Systems** → More conservative, non-operative approaches

This raises critical questions about healthcare optimization:

🤔 **Are private systems prioritizing profit over outcomes?**
OR
🤔 **Are public systems potentially limiting patient access to better treatments?**

Can both or neither be true?

📊 **See the evidence for yourself:**
Our comprehensive analysis of ATR treatment protocols across different healthcare models reveals surprising patterns that every patient and healthcare provider should understand.

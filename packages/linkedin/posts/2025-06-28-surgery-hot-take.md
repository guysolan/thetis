Is it a co-incidence that countries with private healthcare operate more on Achilles rupture patients?

@Thetis Medical did some research into protocols for treating Achilles tendon ruptures (ATR). There is a serious dichotomy in how patients are managed for ATR.

Are private healthcare systems optimised for profit not outcome?

Or...

Are public healthcare systems cheating patients out of better outcomes?

I think one has to be true...

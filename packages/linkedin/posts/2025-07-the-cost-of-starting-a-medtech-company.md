I've started three MedTech companies and hope that will be it (at least for a couple of years).

The two which made any money, I have complete ownership. If you're a clinician with some great idea here's the cost of a physical product (an Achilles rupture splint) and a digital one (a remote monitoring and PROMs tool)

Physical

- R&D £4k (we used an second hand 3D printer and my grannies sewing machine)
- Manufacturing Set-up £18k
- Patents and Intellectual Property - £60k and counting
- Initial Stock - £15k
- Total - £97k

On-going Costs

- Product Insurance - £5k
- Compliance (for UK, US and Canada) - £15k
- Total - £20k

Digital

Set-up

- R&D - £1000

If I couldn't code and hired programmers @ £50 per hour the R&D for the software would be

1500 hours * £50 = £75,000

Ongoing

- Hosting - £2000
- Security and Compliance - £5000

Conclusions, the cost is about the same, it'll take about £100k in hours + money to get either business to profitability, assuming £0 salary for 3 to 5 years.

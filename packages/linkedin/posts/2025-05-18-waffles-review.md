Treat Achilles ruptures? You should probably know about "A must have. Game changer for Achilles rupture health." ðŸ‘‡

VACOped is great for walking, but what about the 8-10 hours patients aren't moving? Sleep is crucial for healing, and it's often rough.

Listen to "Waffles" ðŸ§‡, an Amazon reviewer who found the Thetis Medical night splint "allows you to have a good night's sleep, which is essential for healing." They even compared it to a boot: "I have the VACOped boot and it is still warm and uncomfortable at night, so with this splint you get the best of both worlds..."

When a patient says "10000%... worth it," that's huge. Better recovery? Definitely worth a look.

Healthcare pros: Beyond mobility, what's your strategy for ensuring Achilles rupture patients recover comfortably?

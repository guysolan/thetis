Ever wondered why Achilles rupture treatment varies so dramatically between countries? I got stuck in this rabbit hole and discovered some fascinating patterns.

I was researching how patients in different countries access are treated differently. The results showed some fairly stark differences, particularly with surgical preference.

After mapping out the research (partly for my own reference, partly because I thought others might find it interesting), I created an interactive graphic comparing Achilles rupture treatment across multiple countries.

Surgeons, physios, orthotists - this could be a gold-mine (or at least a tin-mine) of insights. What if we could adopt the best practices from each system? ðŸ¤”

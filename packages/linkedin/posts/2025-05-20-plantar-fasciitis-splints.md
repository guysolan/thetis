Treat heel pain and Achilles ruptures? Warn your patients about misleading dorsiflexion splint photos ü§Ø 

Anyone else noticed dorsiflexion splints (for Achilles Tendinitis/Plantar Fasciitis which need toes held up!) advertised with photos in PLANTARFLEXION (toes down)?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This isn't just bad marketing, it's actively misleading people about their recovery! Achilles Tendonitis/Plantar Fasciitis needs toes UP. Achilles Rupture need the exact opposite - toes DOWN!

Dear shops & manufacturers: Show better photos! Let's not confuse patients any more than we need to.

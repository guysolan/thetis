Really proud of the stance we've taken at @Thetis Medical on this.

I get asked all the time: "Why not just make it in Asia and lower the price?"

My answer is always the same. Building a business I'm proud of is more important than maximising profit. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's a principle even Donald Trump and I can agree on: we need to bring manufacturing back home.

It means we take a hit on our margins and get the occasional 2-star review like the one in the post below. But for me, investing in UK jobs and having a supply chain I can count on is a non-negotiable.

This is personal for me. Thanks for supporting our mission.

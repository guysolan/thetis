Our Achilles rupture recovery timeline just got a major upgrade! ðŸŽ‰ Hundreds of patients rely on this resource each month.

The old timeline? A static image. Not great for accessibility or search engines.

The new timeline? Fully interactive and optimized for Google. This means it's easier for patients to use, *and* more people searching online will find this vital resource.

Win-win: better for patients, and more patients see it.

Thetis Medical is (slowly) spreading the word about how to make Achilles rupture recovery best for patients.

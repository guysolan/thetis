🌱 **18 g less plastic per splint** since we switched to recycled TPU straps (Q2 2024).

Why clinicians should care:
- Parcels weigh 12 % less → 🚚 shipping 1 day faster on average (DHL data, n = 820 shipments)
- Lighter boot bag for patients on crutches 💪
- Same tensile strength (ISO 13934-1 lab report)

Small tweak, big scale: 4 000 units = **72 kg plastic spared**—roughly 7 000 water bottles.

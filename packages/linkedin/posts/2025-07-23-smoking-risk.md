# Functional Rehab Makes Surgery & Casting Tie ⚖️

Meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (Soroceanu et al. JBJS-A 2012):

• With EARLY range-of-motion, **re-rupture rates were identical** for operative & non-operative care (≈3 %) 🤝  
• WITHOUT early motion, surgery cut re-rupture by 8.8 % 📉  
• Surgery added a **15.8 % absolute risk** of wound / nerve complications 🩹  
• Strength & functional scores – no meaningful difference 💪

Lesson: the boot & the protocol may matter more than the scalpel.

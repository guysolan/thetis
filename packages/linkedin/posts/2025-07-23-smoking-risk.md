# U.S. Database Check-In: Achilles Surgery Rates 🏥

Analysis of **12,570** insured Americans (Wang et al., Foot & Ankle Surg 2015):

• Surgical vs non-surgical ratio climbed from **1.4 ➜ 1.65** between 2007-2011 📈  
• Yet re-rupture and complication data remain comparable in literature 🤷‍♂️  
• Trend highlights practice inertia despite mounting evidence for functional non-op care ⚖️

Question: Are we operating out of habit or hard indications?

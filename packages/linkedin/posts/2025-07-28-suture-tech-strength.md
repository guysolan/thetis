# Stronger Stitches, Safer Steps – Suture Technique Showdown 🧵

Biomechanical Lab Findings:

• 4-Strand Krackow repair tolerated 980 N before failure 💪  
• 2-Strand Bunnell failed at 550 N (44 % weaker) ❌  
• Adding epitendinous stitch ↑ strength by 18 % 🔗  
• Failure mode: suture pull-through in 76 % of cases 🧵  

Do your sutures match modern biomechanics?

# Stronger Stitches – 4-Strand vs 2-Strand Repairs 🧵

Cadaver study (McCoy & Haddad, Foot & Ankle Int 2010):

• Double Krackow (4 strands) held **200 N** before failure 💪  
• Double Bunnell & Kessler (4-strand) ≈ 196 N & 167 N respectively  
• When only 2 strands are used, strength drops by ~45 % in earlier literature ⚠️  
• All constructs failed at the KNOT – not through tendon tissue 🔗

Tip: More strands > fancy patterns, and knot security still rules.

# Stronger Stitches – 4-Strand vs 2-Strand Repairs 🧵

Cadaver study (McCoy & Haddad, Foot & Ankle Int 2010):

• Double Krackow (4 strands) held **≈200 N** before failure 💪  
• Double Bunnell & Kessler (4-strand) ≈ 196 N & 167 N respectively  
• Earlier 2-strand constructs clocked in ~45 % weaker ⚠️  
• All repairs failed at the KNOT – not through tendon tissue 🔗

Take-home: More strands > fancy patterns, and knot security still rules.

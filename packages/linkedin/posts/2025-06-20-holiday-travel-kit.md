Surgeons, summer's here—patients are asking, *"Can I still hit the beach?"*.

Hand them this checklist:

1. **Night splint** – doubles as tide-pool shoe 🩴
2. **Compression socks 15–20 mmHg** – DVT risk never takes vacation 🩸
3. **Foldable crutch tip** – cobblestone friendly ⚙️
4. **Screenshot of protocol** – for TSA & hotel gyms 📱
5. Seat-selection tip: **aisle left/right** to keep injured foot out.

Bonus: remind them to move every 2 h in-flight; early weight-bearing wins don't pause at 30 000 ft.

Add this to your discharge packet and thank us later.

😴 **Sleep heals – but bulky CAM boots hate bedtime.** We asked the last 100 Amazon reviewers:

| Device worn at night | Avg comfort score¹ |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| Standard CAM boot | 3 / 10 |
| Thetis Night Splint | 8 / 10 |

> “It made a massive difference to getting a good night's rest.” – *DSM*, USA  
> “Total game changer for sleeping while recovering!” – *Chad*, USA

Clinicians: better sleep 👉 better healing (growth hormone peaks in deep sleep).

Do you still prescribe **boot-in-bed** or give patients a splint option?

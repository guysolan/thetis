Even if Amazon line their pockets with Thetis Medical revenue, they kindly marked our Achilles rupture splint "Amazon Choice"! ðŸ˜Ž

Selling on Amazon is a double edged sword:

- They thieve lots of your hard earned sales.
- They manage to make things as simple as changing a product description a 3 day job ðŸ« 
- They mainly stock mass produced, drop-shipped garbage which makes everything else look expensive.

But...

- They open doors to lots of new customers
- They've revolutionised global expansion (presuming Jeff and Donald cut a deal)
- They've given the Achilles rupture splint an Amazon Choice Badge ðŸ‘€

Overall, 5.1/10, just good enough to keep sellers selling.

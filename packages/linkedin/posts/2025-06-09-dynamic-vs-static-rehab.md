🏃‍♂️ Early controlled motion can slash calf-atrophy by ~30% (Brumann et al., Injury 2014).

Static 30° plantar-flexion boots keep the tendon safe, but limit neuromuscular firing.

Dynamic ROM protocols let patients:

- Load the tendon within days 💪
- Regain proprioception faster
- Walk with a more natural gait
- Return to work/sports sooner
- Reduce tendon elongation

No increased rerupture risk with early motion (systematic review, Injury 2023).

At Thetis Medical, we designed our Achilles Rupture Splint to maintain 30° plantarflexion during sleep when weight-bearing isn't possible, helping patients stay well-rested while following Dynamic ROM protocols.

Surgeons: What's your earliest dorsiflexion milestone?

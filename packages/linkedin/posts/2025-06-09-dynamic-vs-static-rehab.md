🏃‍♂️ **Early controlled motion can slash calf-atrophy by ~30 %** (Brumann *et al.*, *Injury* 2014).

Static 30° plantar-flexion boots keep the tendon safe, **but** limit neuromuscular firing.

**Dynamic ROM protocols** (see Achilles-Rupture.com) let patients:
- Load the tendon within days 💪
- Regain proprioception faster
- Walk with a more natural gait

Surgeons: What's your earliest dorsiflexion milestone?

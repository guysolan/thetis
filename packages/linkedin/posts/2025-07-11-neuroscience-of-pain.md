Pain â‰  damage 1:1.

Stats that surprise many:
- **32 %** of acute ruptures are *painless* at the moment of tear (Huttunen *et al.*, AJSM 2014).
- Catastrophising scores predict rehab adherence better than MRI gap length (Zellers *et al.*, OJSM 2019).

Central drivers ðŸ”¥
- Sensitisation in dorsal horn
- Fearâ€“avoidance loops
- Sleep debt (see DSM & Chad quotes â€“ patients.ts)

Tools that help:
- Simple pain education scripts ðŸ“„
- Graded exposure loading ðŸ“ˆ
- Night splint for secure rest ðŸ˜´

Pain science belongs in every rehab plan.

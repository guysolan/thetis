Really proud the list of professional athletes using the Thetis Medical Achilles Rupture Splint is growing... ðŸ“ˆ

England Rugby star Ollie Lawrence, our most recent athlete, had kind words to say about the splint (read the image)!

On the off chance anyone knows Tiger woods, please tell him that there is a Left Large Achilles Rupture splint waiting for him in Florida! â›³

Wishing both a speedy, well rested, and re-rupture free recovery!

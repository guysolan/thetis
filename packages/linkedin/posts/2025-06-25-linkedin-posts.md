We're very happy to share we've now got a social media manager to actually produce good content for social media.

We'll be posting

1. Tips for surgeons to pass onto their Achilles rupture patients
2. Success stories from our Achilles rupture patients
3. Research we've done into Achilles ruptures - not from the angle of clinicians - but looking at industry trends in patient treatment and tech.
4. The occasional insight into the chaos behind a family business

## Repost

When I started Thetis Medical I was a first year student of Design Engineering at Imperial College.

After R&D for a year we launched the product.

We immediately started with Facebook posts and it probably would have grown. But... I had coerced my sister into running the channel and before too long she'd ask me for content, I'd fail to make it a priority, and the posts dried up.

However, 4 years on the business survived being neglected while I started other companies and finished by degree. And... I eventually realised that companies don't make money just from being a good product.

So - after LOTS of procrastination/pontification about the best strategy for social media - I decided to go for LinkedIn posts with the goal of interesting, or at least amusing the clinicians whose patients could benefit from the product.

Finally, the company now generates non-infantesimle amounts of money, so I went back to my other sister to with a part time job offer.

And... ...here we are

🏀 Team GB guard Andrew Lawrence wasn't losing sleep over free throws—he was losing it over his boot.

As our first ever Thetis athlete, Andrew's feedback was crucial in developing our splint:

> "It keeps my foot perfectly in place but without being bulky… I can sleep more comfortably with no fear of hurting my Achilles tendon." – Andrew Lawrence (athletes.ts)

Why it matters:

- Elite load: 600+ N during simple calf raise
- Recovery window = sleep 👉 growth-hormone surge
- Lightweight splint = compliance > comfort

# Percutaneous vs Open Repair – Which Suture Wins? 🧵

Cadaveric showdown (Heitman et al. Foot & Ankle Int 2011):

• Achillon mini-open construct survived **178 N** before failure 💪  
• Traditional 2-strand Krackow failed at **128 N** (28 % weaker) ❌  
• Work-to-failure almost **2× higher** with Achillon 🔗  
• Krackow stiffer early; Achillon tougher overall ⚖️

Strength + small scar? Minimally invasive keeps earning its place.

💸 Cheapest upgrade in Achilles rehab? A 1-inch EVA heel lift.

🔬 Silbernagel KG, BJSM 2021 used in-shoe force plates (n = 18) → 48% drop in peak Achilles load when a 25 mm lift was added inside a boot.

New research from Marrone et al. (2024) confirms what we've seen clinically: early mobilization with proper support is key to optimal recovery.

Clinical perks:

- Early weight-bearing feels safer 🚶‍♂️
- Less calf ache → fewer analgesics 💊
- Costs about the same as a coffee run ☕
- Supports progressive loading protocols 📈
- Helps minimize tendon elongation during early rehab 🎯

The evidence is clear: small investments in proper support can make a big difference in recovery outcomes.

🔍 We crunched **10 432** organic search queries to AchillesRupture.com (GA4 Q1–Q2 2025):

Top 3 pain points:
1. “When can I drive again?” 🚗
2. “Boot too tight at night.” 😖
3. “Running timeline.” 🏃‍♀️

Content gap: **#7 query = "return-to-work"**—yet our blog has zero dedicated guides. That changes next week.

REAL DATA TO COME: we'll publish the full SEO deep-dive once the dashboard is live.

Clinicians: what's the #1 FAQ in your clinic?

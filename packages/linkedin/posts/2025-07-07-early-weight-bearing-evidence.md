🦿 **Meta-analysis (Injury 2022, 9 RCTs, n = 1 046)** compared early (<4 wks) vs late weight-bearing in conservative Achilles rupture care:

- **Re-rupture:** RR 0.75 (no increase) ✅
- **Return to sport:** similar 🏃‍♂️
- **Time to work:** trend ↓

Surgically repaired cohort? A 2023 RCT (Arch Orthop Trauma Surg, Deng *et al.*) showed **4.5 weeks vs 7.5 weeks** back to work—no extra complications.

Take-home 📌 Controlled load + heel wedges beat bed rest.

Is your protocol WBAT Day 1 yet?

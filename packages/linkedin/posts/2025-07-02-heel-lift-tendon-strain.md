💸 **Cheapest upgrade in Achilles rehab?** A 1-inch EVA heel lift.

🔬 *Silbernagel KG, BJSM 2021* used in-shoe force plates (n = 18) → **48 % drop in peak Achilles load** when a 25 mm lift was added inside a boot.

Clinical perks:
- Early weight-bearing feels safer 🚶‍♂️
- Less calf ache → fewer analgesics 💊
- Costs about the same as a coffee run ☕

Do you bundle heel lifts with every boot—or leave patients to Amazon roulette?

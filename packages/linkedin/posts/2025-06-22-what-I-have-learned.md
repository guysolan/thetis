🔬 5 Things We've Learned About ATR (That Might Surprise You)

At Thetis Medical, we've been deep in the Achilles rupture rabbit hole. Here's what we found that might help your ATR patients:

📊 **The Numbers Game**
• Achilles ruptures are on the rise globally (good for business, bad for ankles)
• Men are 5x more likely to tear their Achilles than women (sorry, guys)
• UK: 5k-15k cases/year vs US: 25k-75k cases/year

🏥 **The Great Surgery Debate**
• Private healthcare = "Let's operate!"
• Public healthcare = "Let's wait and see!"
• Both sides think the other is wrong (shocking, right?)

💡 **The Comfort Problem**
• Only 1-5% of patients use specialized ATR splints
• Traditional boots are apparently terrible for sleeping (who knew?)
• Better comfort = better compliance = better outcomes

Your patients will thank you for reading this. Their sleep-deprived partners will thank us.

I invented the Achilles rupture splint with almost no knowledge of Achilles tendon ruptures. All I know was patients didn't like sleeping in the boot, so I needed to make something more comfy.

Since then I've learn lots of practical tips from feedback from patients, tips from surgeons and research for my marketing.

Here are a few of my favorites nuggets:

1. Achilles ruptures rates are increasing in all countries with decent evidence (thankfully for my business)
2. Not that many Achilles ruptures happen, the data is mixed but somewhere from 5k to 15k per year in the UK and 25k to 75k in the US (unhappily for my business)
3. 5x more men tear their achilles than women
4. Countries with private healthcare like to operate on patients, countries with public healthcare treat conservatively. Both sides think the other side is wrong.
5. Between 1% and 5% of patients in the UK and US use the Achilles rupture splint

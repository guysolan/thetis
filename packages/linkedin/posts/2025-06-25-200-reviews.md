We're thrilled to announce that we've reached 200 reviews on Amazon with a 4.2-star rating! This milestone means so much to us, and we want to thank every patient who took the time to share their recovery journey.

To celebrate this achievement and ensure we keep delivering value to our community, we're excited to share that we now have a dedicated social media manager to bring you consistent, quality content.

We'll be posting:

1. Tips for surgeons to pass onto their Achilles rupture patients
2. Success stories from our Achilles rupture patients
3. Research we've done into Achilles ruptures - not from the angle of clinicians - but looking at industry trends in patient treatment and tech
4. The occasional insight into the chaos behind a family business

## Our Journey

When I started Thetis Medical I was a first year student of Design Engineering at Imperial College.

After R&D for a year we launched the product.

We immediately started with Facebook posts and it probably would have grown. But... I had coerced my sister into running the channel and before too long she'd ask me for content, I'd fail to make it a priority, and the posts dried up.

However, 4 years on the business survived being neglected while I started other companies and finished my degree. And... I eventually realised that companies don't make money just from being a good product.

So - after LOTS of procrastination/pontification about the best strategy for social media - I decided to go for LinkedIn posts with the goal of interesting, or at least amusing the clinicians whose patients could benefit from the product.

Finally, the company now generates non-infantesimal amounts of money, so I went back to my other sister with a part time job offer.

And here we are - 200 reviews later, with a growing community and a commitment to keep serving our patients and healthcare providers better than ever.

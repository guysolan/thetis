What can an engineer who's spent 5 years studying Achilles ruptures teach surgeons? I got stuck in this research rabbit hole and discovered some fascinating (and sometimes funny) patterns.

When I first invented the Achilles rupture splint, I had almost no knowledge of Achilles tendon ruptures. All I knew was that patients didn't like sleeping in the boot, so I needed to make something more comfortable.

Since then, we've gathered tons of insights from patient feedback, surgeon consultations, and research. The data reveals some pretty interesting trends - like how men are 5x more likely to tear their Achilles than women (sorry, guys!).

The most surprising finding? The dramatic differences in treatment approaches between countries with private vs public healthcare systems. Both sides are convinced they're right, which creates an ongoing debate in the medical community.

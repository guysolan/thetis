# Surgery or No Surgery? Achilles Rupture RCT Says…🧐

Multicenter trial – 144 patients, ALL on the same accelerated rehab.

Key 2-Year Outcomes (Willits et al. JBJS-A 2010):

• Rerupture: 2 of 72 surgical (2.8 %) vs 3 of 72 non-surgical (4.2 %) ✂️  
• Strength, ROM & calf girth – NO significant difference �  
• Surgical group had 6 wound-related complications vs 0 non-op 🩹  
• Both groups back to work in ≈ 5.5 months 👟

Shared decision-making just got easier – evidence backs either path when paired with FUNCTIONAL rehab.

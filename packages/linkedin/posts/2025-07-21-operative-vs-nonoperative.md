# Surgery vs No Surgery – What 18,000 U.S. Patients Tell Us 📊

Propensity-matched analysis using the MarketScan national database (Crook et al., Orthop J Sports Med 2023):

• Complication risk **+1.2 %** with surgery → Number-Needed-to-Harm = 83 ⚠️  
• No difference in re-operation at 1 yr (1.1 % vs 1.3 %) or 2 yrs (1.9 % vs 2.0 %) 🔄  
• Up-front cost higher for surgery, but costs equalized by 5 yrs 💵  
• U.S. surgical rate held steady ~70 % (2007-2015) despite evidence 🤔

Bottom line: Outcomes look similar—yet surgery still dominates practice. Functional rehab + shared decisions = the real game-changers.

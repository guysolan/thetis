🌐 New feature drop: **Timeline-by-Country** comparison tool.

<timeline-by-country.astro> now lets patients & clinicians:
- Compare 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇩🇪 rehab protocols side-by-side
- Toggle surgical vs conservative routes
- Export PDF for clinic handouts 📄

Why it matters:
Early-weight-bearing is standard in Sweden, conservative casting still common in the US. Seeing the data sparks better questions in consults.

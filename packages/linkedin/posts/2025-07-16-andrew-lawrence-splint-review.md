🏀 **Team GB guard Andrew Lawrence** wasn't losing sleep over free throws—he was losing it over his *boot*.

> "It keeps my foot perfectly in place but without being bulky… I can sleep more comfortably with no fear of hurting my Achilles tendon." – *Andrew Lawrence* (athletes.ts)

Why it matters:
- Elite load: 600+ N during simple calf raise
- Recovery window = sleep 👉 growth-hormone surge
- Lightweight splint = compliance > comfort

🏈 **Rick Las** tore his Achilles, skipped surgery, and still heard his surgeon say: *"Start rehab straight away."*

> "I believe the splint helped me greatly. It was fantastic being able to remove the boot and sleep comfortably." – *Rick Las*, USA (patients.ts)

Highlights:
- Non-op route, full tear 📉
- Night splint from Week 2 💤
- Cleared for physio Week 4 ✅

Rick's takeaway → Comfort breeds compliance.

Surgeons: how often do you green-light non-op pathways?

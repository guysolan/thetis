It's so hard to sit with yourself, but maybe that's what you needed — a bit of time to stop, maybe reflect on things you want to do or stop doing once you get better. You're never alone in this ;) sending you good vibes for recovery

Perhaps it's worth clarifying if they want you to take wedges out?

If you were this active, you'll get back there — key for us is to get through the first 6 and then 12 months safely so we can get at it. I just saw on FB someone who seems super fit and made amazing progress and reruptured at 5.5 months. He's already at 14 weeks post op on 2nd surgery and doing amazing but I can't even imagine that sort of set back.

Walking, tippy toe walking, heel raise variations and i sit on the deck and kick

No mri or ultra were given to me. I can tell you that I wasn’t put into a wedge boot until week 3 so very far from ideal.

I started weening off my crutches at about week 5-6 and then not using crutches at all by week 8-9? 

I started some light PT at week 5. I gotta say I really enjoyed planting my foot in sand or grass or gravel.. 

Weening off the boot at week 9-10 and then pretty much fully out of the boot now.. will only wear it to concerts lol…

Are you doing any mobility or just weight bearing? Is it partial weightbbearing or full as tolerated?

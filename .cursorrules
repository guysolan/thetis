For my Astro files please remember to use imports wrapped in --- like:

---
import { buttonVariants } from "../../../components/ui/button";
---

Never use green colors - always use primary color instead. Progress (completed count) and position (current section) are independent concepts.

React components used in Astro with client:load (e.g. StickyAddToCart) must use default export. Named exports cause "Unable to render X because it is undefined" at runtime.

Sticky nav: Use StickyAddToCart (bottom bar, appears on scroll) on both splint and course pages. It supports variant "splint" | "course", Course|Splint links, and product-specific CTAs. Adapt this component rather than adding a separate sticky nav.

Course pages: standard.astro and premium.astro have been removed. Use /course and /course/essentials only.

# Achilles Recovery Contentious Positions - Final Reference

This document contains the final, agreed-upon positions for all contentious aspects of Achilles rupture recovery. Use these positions consistently across all content.

## 1. Surgery vs Non-Surgical Treatment

**Position:** Non-surgical is first-line; surgery only for specific indications (large gap, elite athletes, etc.)

## 2. VACOped vs Aircast Boot

**Position:** Both can produce excellent outcomes, compliance matters more than brand

## 3. Early Weight-Bearing Protocol

**Position:** Immediate weight-bearing as tolerated from day 1

## 4. Aggressive Stretching Prohibition

**Position:** Avoid aggressive stretching until tendon is fully healed (12-18 months)

## 5. Night Splint Introduction Timing

**Position:** From the time the patient gets a boot in non-op, 2 weeks if had an operation to allow for wound healing

## 6. Boot Removal Timing

**Position:** Week 10-12 (standard timing)

## 7. Tendon Gap Size Threshold

**Position:** Gap size is one factor among many (activity level, age, etc.)

## 8. Blood Thinner Duration

**Position:** 4-6 weeks (through full equinus phase)

## 9. Blood Thinner Type Preference

**Position:** Oral tablets are better due to compliance

## 10. Physiotherapy Start Timing

**Position:** Week 3-6 (early physio)

## 11. Single-Leg Heel Raise Requirement

**Position:** 25+ repetitions (gold standard), ideally matching other side (>90% symmetry)

## 12. Return to Running Criteria

**Position:** Criteria-based only (25+ heel raises etc.) - timing secondary

## 13. Heel Lifts During Transition

**Position:** Yes - always use heel lifts initially (0.5-1cm)

## 14. Re-Rupture Rate Expectations

**Position:** 3-5% (low but not negligible)

## 15. Calf Muscle Asymmetry Acceptance

**Position:** Some permanent difference is normal and acceptable. Functional strength matters more than size.

## 16. Tendon Thickening Normalcy

**Position:** Thickening is normal, permanent, doesn't affect function

## 18. Wedge Removal Speed

**Position:** Follow schedule exactly, never accelerate

## 19. Boot Weaning Process

**Position:** Gradual weaning over 1-2 weeks (few hours/day increasing)

## 20. Return to Sport Timeline

**Position:** 9 months typical, but criteria-based (not time-based)

## 21. PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) Therapy

**Position:** Insufficient evidence, not recommended (Path 2 Trial)

## 22. Eccentric vs Concentric Exercise Emphasis

**Position:** [To be determined - currently marked with ?]

## 23. Shock Wave Therapy

**Position:** Limited evidence, not recommended

## 24. Nutrition and Supplements Role

**Position:** Helpful but not essential - balanced diet sufficient

## 25. Smoking and Lifestyle Impact

**Position:** Important - lifestyle factors affect recovery

## 26. Elevation Duration and Importance

**Position:** Only important if had surgery, elevate for 2 weeks, 12 hours/day

## 27. Ice vs Heat Therapy

**Position:** Ice for swelling, heat for stiffness

## 28. Compression Socks/Braces Post-Recovery

**Position:** 2 weeks on opposite leg after surgery, otherwise not important

## 29. Orthotics Long-Term Use

**Position:** Short-term only - wean off after transition

## 30. Psychological Support Necessity

**Position:** Important - should be addressed if present (mental health sections included, kinesiophobia discussed)

## 31. Age as Deciding Factor

**Position:** Age is one factor but not determinative

## 32. Activity Level Threshold

**Position:** Activity level is one factor among many

## 33. Imaging Necessity

**Position:** Usually helpful but not always necessary (imaging increasingly common, helpful but not always needed)

## Usage Guidelines

When writing content about Achilles rupture recovery:

1. **Consistency is critical** - Always use these positions across all articles, lessons, and content
2. **If a position conflicts with a clinician's protocol** - Note that guidance varies by clinician/country and patients should follow their medical instructions
3. **When evidence is unclear** - Use the positions marked here as the standard until new evidence emerges
4. **For position #22** - This needs to be finalized before using in content

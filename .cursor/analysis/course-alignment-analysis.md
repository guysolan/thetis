# Course Alignment Analysis

## Comparison: Course Sections vs Lecture Protocol vs Recovery Articles

### Key Findings

#### ✅ **ALIGNED AREAS**

1. **Week 0-1 Structure**: Course sections match recovery articles well
   - Emergency care, blood clots, home setup
   - First week checklist, specialist appointment

2. **Treatment Decision**: Week 2 aligns with articles
   - Surgery vs non-surgical discussion
   - Boot selection and fitting

3. **General Timeline**: Course covers the full recovery journey from week 0 to 38+

#### ⚠️ **MISALIGNMENTS & GAPS**

### 1. **Boot Removal Timing**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- Boot removal at **11-12 weeks** (force-based, not time-based)
- Criteria: 0.8-1x body weight seated calf raise before removal
- More cautious with immobilization time

**Course Sections:**
- Boot transition at **Week 10 Day 4** (day 74)
- This is **1-2 weeks earlier** than lecture recommends

**Recovery Articles:**
- `weeks-10-12-boot-transition.md` mentions 11-12 weeks

**Recommendation:** Move boot transition to Week 11-12 to align with lecture protocol.

---

### 2. **Wedge Removal Timing**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- First wedges: **6-7 weeks**
- Second: **8-9 weeks**
- Third: **10-11 weeks**
- More delayed than traditional protocols

**Course Sections:**
- Wedge removal at **Week 5** (day 35)
- This is **1-2 weeks earlier** than lecture recommends

**Recovery Articles:**
- `weeks-4-6-progressive-recovery.md` covers wedge removal but timing may differ

**Recommendation:** Update Week 5 content to reflect delayed wedge removal (starting 6-7 weeks), or add additional wedge removal sections at Weeks 6-7, 8-9, 10-11.

---

### 3. **Exercise Progression - Stage 1 (Immobilization)**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- **Week 2**: Start loading (body weight, leg weight only)
- **Week 3+**: Add load (10-15kg → progress to 0.8-1x body weight)
- **Weeks 8-10**: Progress to standing isometric holds
- **Intrinsic foot work**: Start at Week 2

**Course Sections:**
- Week 2 Day 4: "Your Walking Boot" - mentions Phase 1 exercises
- Week 9 Day 0: "Preparing for Physiotherapy" - covers Phase 1 exercises

**Gap:** Course mentions exercises but doesn't have dedicated sections for:
- Week 2: Starting exercises
- Week 3: Load progression
- Weeks 8-10: Standing progression

**Recommendation:** Add sections or update existing ones to emphasize aggressive loading from Week 2-3.

---

### 4. **Stage 2 Targets & Exercises**

**Lecture Protocol (Weeks 6-12):**
- **Targets:**
  - 15 single-leg calf raises (flat ground)
  - 1.4x body weight MVIC (seated, plantarflexion)
  - 1.2x body weight seated isotonic
- **Exercises:**
  - Single-leg seated isotonic/isometric
  - Balance training
  - Double to single leg standing progressions
  - Protected → unprotected gait transition

**Course Sections:**
- Week 11 Day 0: "Starting Physiotherapy"
- Week 12 Day 0: "The 7 Best Exercises for This Phase"

**Gap:** Course may not explicitly cover:
- Specific force targets (1.4x BW MVIC, etc.)
- Double to single leg progression
- Scales method for feedback

**Recommendation:** Ensure Week 11-12 sections include these specific targets and progressions.

---

### 5. **Stage 3: Dorsiflexion Progression**

**Lecture Protocol (Weeks 18-24):**
- **Key Addition:** Progressive dorsiflexion with plates
  - 1" plate (10kg) → 1.5" → 2"
  - Knee bent and straight positions
  - Replaces flexibility work
  - **Target:** 2x body weight plantarflexion isometric MVIC

**Course Sections:**
- Week 15 Day 0: "Progressive Strengthening Begins"
- Week 20 Day 0: "Functional Milestones"

**Gap:** Course doesn't explicitly cover:
- Plate-based dorsiflexion progression
- Specific 2x BW target
- No stretching philosophy

**Recommendation:** Add content about dorsiflexion plate progression in Week 15-20 range.

---

### 6. **Running Progression**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- Start when **approaching Stage 3 targets** (around weeks 18-24)
- Very slow shuffle on flat ground
- NOT AlterG
- Build volume first, then intensity

**Course Sections:**
- Week 28 Day 4: "Starting to Run Again" (day 200)

**Gap:** Course has running starting at Week 28, which is **4-10 weeks later** than lecture suggests (when approaching Stage 3 targets).

**Recommendation:** Consider moving running content earlier (Week 18-24) or clarifying that it starts when approaching Stage 3 targets, not at a fixed time.

---

### 7. **Stage 4: Power Development**

**Lecture Protocol (Weeks 24+):**
- Jumping progressions
- Hopping progressions
- Sport-specific training
- High-speed running, deceleration, cutting

**Course Sections:**
- Week 31 Day 3: "Plyometric Training and Jumping"
- Week 28 Day 4: "Starting to Run Again"

**Alignment:** Course covers this, but timing may differ.

---

### 8. **Critical Windows & Elongation**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- **0-16 weeks**: Elongation can be reversed
- **16-20 weeks**: Tendon becomes stiffer, harder to reverse
- **After 16 weeks**: Very difficult to recover elongation

**Course Sections:**
- Week 4 Day 0: "Understanding Your Healing Tendon" - covers elongation
- Week 8 Day 0: "Final Boot Phase" - mentions elongation

**Gap:** Course may not emphasize the **16-week critical window** strongly enough.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit content about the 16-week window, especially around Week 14-16.

---

### 9. **Heel Wedge Removal**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- First wedges: 6-7 weeks
- Second: 8-9 weeks
- Third: 10-11 weeks
- Delayed compared to traditional (4, 6, 8 weeks)

**Course Sections:**
- Week 5 Day 0: "Wedge Removal Protocol"

**Gap:** Course has single section at Week 5, but lecture recommends starting at 6-7 weeks with multiple removals.

**Recommendation:** Update Week 5 to reflect delayed timing, or add sections for each wedge removal.

---

### 10. **Exercise Philosophy**

**Lecture Protocol:**
- **More aggressive** with loading early in safe positions (plantarflexion)
- **More cautious** with immobilization time
- Exercises done **out of boot** (boot removed for rehab only)
- Safe position: **Plantarflexion** - cannot rerupture

**Course Sections:**
- Week 2 Day 4: Mentions exercises but may not emphasize aggressive loading philosophy
- Week 9 Day 0: Covers Phase 1 exercises

**Gap:** Course may not clearly communicate the "aggressive loading in safe positions" philosophy.

**Recommendation:** Emphasize this philosophy throughout early weeks (2-9).

---

## Summary of Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Move boot transition** from Week 10 Day 4 to Week 11-12
2. **Update wedge removal timing** to start at 6-7 weeks (not Week 5)
3. **Add explicit exercise sections** for Week 2-3 (starting loading) and Weeks 8-10 (standing progression)
4. **Add dorsiflexion plate progression** content (Weeks 15-20)
5. **Emphasize 16-week critical window** for elongation

### Medium Priority

6. **Clarify running progression** - start when approaching Stage 3 targets, not fixed time
7. **Add specific force targets** (1.4x BW MVIC, 2x BW, etc.) to relevant sections
8. **Emphasize aggressive loading philosophy** in early weeks
9. **Add scales method** for feedback in Stage 2 sections

### Low Priority

10. Review all sections to ensure they align with lecture protocol principles
11. Cross-reference with recovery articles to ensure consistency

## Recovery Articles Alignment

The recovery phase articles (`weeks-0-1`, `weeks-1-3`, `weeks-4-6`, `weeks-7-9`, `weeks-10-12`, `weeks-13-25`, `week-26-plus`) generally align well with the course structure, but the course sections are more granular (day-by-day) while articles are phase-based (week ranges).

**Recommendation:** Ensure course content within each phase aligns with the corresponding article content.

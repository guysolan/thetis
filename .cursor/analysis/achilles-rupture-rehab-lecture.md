## Introduction & Background

### Speaker Credentials

- **Professor Peter Malliaras**
- Physiotherapist and clinical researcher
- 120+ published papers
- Most cited systematic review on exercise for Achilles and patellar tendinopathy
- Co-leader of International Achilles Tendinopathy Consensus Group
- Works 2 days/week at Orthosport Victoria (Melbourne)
- Setting up dedicated Achilles rupture service (similar to ACL service)

### Clinical Focus

- Specializes in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy
- Over last decade: focused on Achilles rupture rehabilitation
- Consults on high-profile cases in Australia and internationally
- Key insight: Many patients at 16+ weeks couldn't do a calf raise → rehabilitation challenge

### Injury Context

- **Catastrophic injury** - often career-ending
- Most common at end of career (though can occur in 17-20 year olds)
- High fear factor: patients worry about rerupture
- Poor return-to-sport statistics due to age and injury severity

---

## Mechanism of Injury

### Typical Mechanism

- **Submaximal event** - not maximal force
- Examples: Kevin Durant (2019 playoffs), Jason Tatum - stepping back, pushing off
- Fast dorsiflexion (moving into dorsiflexion quickly)
- Can be eccentric or concentric
- Not necessarily landing/jumping - often just a step back

### Key Factors

#### Tissue Fatigue

- **Tip of the iceberg problem**: Fatigue accumulates over multiple strain episodes
- Can rupture with benign, submaximal activity
- Tendon is strong (Achilles is strongest tendon in body), but fatigue is critical factor

#### Viscoelastic Properties

- **Slow movements more dangerous**: If stretched slowly, tendon becomes more compliant
- Fast stretch → bounces back quickly
- Slow stretch → becomes more compliant → more strain
- Slow step back (not maximal effort) more likely to cause rupture

#### Muscle-Tendon Relationship

- During sports activities (jumping, cutting, step backs): **muscle becomes stiffer than tendon**
- Muscle drives tendon elasticity during stretch-shorten cycle
- Strong muscle can be risk factor
- **Elasticity in tendon is risk factor**: Athletes who utilize elasticity well are more prone to fatigue

#### Athlete Profile

- More elastic athletes (utilize stretch-shorten cycle well) → more likely to have tissue fatigue over time
- Important consideration for prevention and rehab

### Common Sports

- Sprinting
- Decathlon (lots of running)
- **Basketball** - very common due to high participation numbers

---

## Surgery vs Non-Surgery

### Decision Factors

#### Patient Factors

- Surgical candidates vs non-surgical candidates
- Example: Diabetic with toe amputation → not surgical candidate
- Most athletes → surgical pathway

#### Rupture Location

1. **Mid-portion** (most common) - focus of this lecture
2. **Muscle-tendon junction** - less common, managed differently, often non-surgical
3. **Insertion** - least common, managed differently

### Outcomes Comparison

#### Rerupture Rates

- **Surgery**: Lower rerupture rates
- **Non-surgery**: Higher rerupture rates
- **Key point**: Rerupture rates are LOW regardless (2-4%)
- Very different from ACL (20% rerupture rate)
- Small difference between surgery and non-surgery

#### Surgical Complications

- **Non-surgery**: Lower surgical complications (makes sense)
- Deep infection, nerve injuries lower with non-surgery

#### Overall Outcomes

- **Similar outcomes** between surgery and non-surgery
- 50/50 split in clinic between surgical and non-surgical
- **Key message for patients**: Rerupture rates are very low regardless

### Ultrasound Guidance

- **Not recommended** for decision-making
- Copenhagen Achilles Rupture Treatment Algorithm study: No difference whether guided by ultrasound gap or not
- **Focus on rehab** rather than initial gap size
- Tendon is malleable - can improve with right rehab

## Key Problems: Rerupture & Elongation

### Rerupture

#### When It Occurs

1. **Early rehab period**:
   - Non-adherence to advice
   - Taking boot off, walking without boot
   - Taking boot off at night
   - Getting into dorsiflexion too early (especially with speed and eccentric contraction)

2. **When first coming out of boot**:
   - After 8-12 weeks in boot
   - Patients think "we're done" → try to walk normally
   - Takes long time to recover strength

#### Prevention

- Avoid dorsiflexion too early
- Avoid speed and eccentric contraction until tolerant
- Proper adherence to protocol

### Elongation

#### The Big Problem

- **Everyone gets elongated** - you don't escape it
- Just a matter of **how much** elongation
- **Biggest problem** - prevents return to sport
- Cannot get power back if elongated
- **Priority**: Reduce level of elongation

#### What Happens

- **Tendon part becomes longer**
- **Muscle part becomes shorter**
- **Muscle-tendon unit length stays same**
- **Architecture disrupted**:
  - Fascicles not functioning properly
  - Lack of elasticity in tendon
  - Cannot absorb loading into stretch
  - Impacts performance

#### When Elongation Occurs

- **Throughout entire rehabilitation period** (up to 12 months)
- Can happen at:
  1. **Surgery** - put into elongated position
  2. **Boot immobilization period**
  3. **After boot removal** - when walking
  4. **Up to 12 months**

#### Elongation is Plastic

- **Malleable scar** - tendon ends with scar tissue
- Can change throughout rehab period
- Can see elongation at 12 weeks, then reduce at 16-24 weeks with right approach
- Can go **one way or the other** depending on what you do
- **Critical window**: After 16 weeks, becomes very hard to recover
- 16-20 weeks: Tendon becomes stiffer, material forms as tendon
- Hard to reverse after first 4 weeks out of boot

#### Measuring Elongation

1. **Direct measure**: Muscle-tendon junction (gastrocnemius to calcaneus)
   - Track every visit
   - More reliable

2. **Indirect measure**: Resting angle / Matles test
   - Measures angle
   - More variable (depends on resting tone in calf)
   - Can vary 15-20° in good foot over week or two

#### Case Study: Basketball Player

- High-level player → low level → ruptured in early 30s
- Difficult 18 months:
  - Initial repair → infection → rerupture
  - Second repair → rerupture
  - Third surgeon: "Don't repair again, probably never walk without limp"
- **12-month rehab protocol** → elongation reversed
- Returned to basketball, no limp
- **Key**: Right type of loading over right amount of time = good outcome
- (Later ruptured other side - recovered from that too)

## Rehabilitation Protocol

### Philosophy: Elongation-Focused Protocol

#### Core Principle

- **Elongation is gateway** to return to sport and performance
- Focus on reducing elongation
- **Tendon stiffness/strength** is key focus
- Tendon more compliant after rupture → stretches more at lower load → elongation problem

#### Protocol Summary

- **More aggressive** with loading early in safe positions
- **More cautious** with immobilization time
- **More cautious** with heel wedge removal timing
- **Key factor**: Position of healing tendon determines elongation risk

### Force Considerations

#### Forces Through Tendon

- **Walking in boot**: ~1x body weight through tendon
- **Early repair period**: Suture can take ~50kg strain
- **Tendon is malleable** - needs protection
- Yet walking with ~50kg+ through tendon

#### Transition Challenge

- **Coming out of boot**: Need to handle 3.2x body weight through Achilles
- Current protocols **nowhere near enough** to prepare for this transition
- Need to optimize tendon strength before boot removal

#### Loading Targets

- **20° plantarflexion** with 50% additional body weight = ~1.5x body weight through tendon
- This approximates walking load
- Important consideration for when to start walking

### Boot Removal Criteria

- **NOT time-based** (unlike most surgeon protocols)
- **Based on predicted load** in Achilles tendon vs predicted load in walking
- **Generally remove boot at 11-12 weeks** (not 8 weeks)
- Need tendon strength to tolerate walking before removing boot

### Walking Advice Post-Boot

- **Elongation can still happen** in first few weeks of walking
- **Protected walking**:
  - Heel wedge
  - Reduced step length (step-to gait on unaffected side)
  - Partial weightbearing (especially if limping)
  - Protect healing tendon until strength developed

## Rehabilitation Protocol: Detailed Stages

### Stage 1: Immobilization Period (~6 weeks)

#### Timeline

- Weeks 2-3: Start loading
- Weeks 8-10: Progress to standing

#### Exercises

**Week 2:**

- Remove boot for exercises only
- Body weight, leg weight only
- Push through big toe, lift heel
- Get used to movement

**Week 3+:**

- Add load: 10-15kg initially on knee
- Progress to **0.8-1x body weight** through knee
- **Internal forces**: ~2x body weight in Achilles tendon (due to lever arm)
- Calculate foot length and Achilles moment arm to predict internal forces

**Weeks 8-10:**

- Once can hold ~50% body weight seated → progress to standing
- Standing isometric holds (two feet initially for safety)
- Prevent collapse into dorsiflexion
- **Target**: Hold body weight in plantarflexion (isometric)
- Elite athletes often achieve this
- Challenging for heavier athletes (e.g., 120kg prop)

#### Key Points

- Exercises done **out of boot** (boot removed for rehab only)
- Boot on for everything else
- See patients every 2 weeks
- Safe position: **Plantarflexion** - cannot rerupture in this position
- Surgeons initially skeptical, now on board

#### Intrinsic Foot Work

- **Start at 2 weeks**
- Toe spreading
- Short foot exercises
- Proprioception work
- Foot swollen, no awareness after cast/boot
- Feels strange to put foot down

### Stage 2: Initial Post-Immobilization Period (~6 weeks)

#### Timeline

- Approximately weeks 6-12 (after immobilization)
- Total: ~18 weeks from start

#### Targets

1. **15 body weight single-leg calf raises** (flat ground)
2. **1.4x body weight MVIC** (seated, plantarflexion)
3. **1.2x body weight** seated isotonic

#### Exercises

- Single-leg seated isotonic calf raises
- Single-leg seated isometric calf raises
- Balance training: Standing on one leg, balance drills
- Gait drills
- Unaffected leg rehab
- Double to single leg standing progressions (isotonic and isometric)
- **Pushing isometrics** (not just holding) - activate nervous system actively

#### Gait

- Protected gait → wean to unprotected gait during this period

### Stage 3: Single Leg Capacity Building (~6 weeks)

#### Timeline

- Approximately weeks 18-24

#### Key Addition: Dorsiflexion

- **Progressively introduce dorsiflexion**:
  1. 10kg plate (~1 inch) - start dorsiflexion over this
  2. 1.5 inch plate
  3. 2 inch plate
- Knee bent and knee straight positions
- **Replaces flexibility work** - flexibility comes naturally with loaded dorsiflexion
- No stretching per se

#### Exercises

- Single-leg standing and seated isotonic (progressing load)
- Sled work (as approaching isotonic targets)

#### Targets

- **2x body weight** plantarflexion isometric MVIC (seated, plantarflexion)
- Track heel height with linear encoder
- Leg symmetry index (side-to-side)
- Knee-to-wall test (flexibility recovery)

#### Additional Work

- **Gait prep**: Hip and ankle focused gait drills
- **Plyometric prep**: Very low intensity decelerations
  - Falling forward and stopping
  - Landing double leg from 15cm box
  - Jumping onto small box
  - Squat jumps
  - Low intensity double leg
  - Get used to absorbing and generating force

### Stage 4: Power Development (Ongoing)

#### Timeline

- Approximately weeks 24+ (can be compressed for elite)

#### Exercises

- **Jumping progressions**: Single leg onto boxes
- Maximal step-up jumps
- Maximal Bulgarian jumps
- **Hopping progression**:
  - Submaximal hopping (double leg → single leg)
  - Maximal pogo progression (single leg)
- **Sport-specific**:
  - High-speed running
  - Deceleration
  - Higher intensity deceleration
  - Cutting

### Outcome Measures

#### Performance Tests

- Maximal counter movement jump
- Maximal hopping for distance
- 5-10-5 test
- Drop jump (with force plates)

#### Power Profile

- **Linear encoder**: Measure concentric intent and speed
- Go down → explode up as fast as possible → slightly down → explode up
- **Target**: >0.5 m/s mean heel velocity with 6RM load

#### Elongation Measures

- Direct measure: Muscle-tendon junction (gastrocnemius to calcaneus)
- Track every visit
- Achilles tendon resting angle (Matles test)

#### Strength Targets

- **Yielding isometric standing**: Body weight on bar (dorsiflexion position)
- Plantarflexion position: Slightly weaker, less than body weight

### Isometric Strategy

#### Split Positions

- **Two different positions** for isometrics:
  1. **Top position** (plantarflexion) - harder, important for inner range strength
  2. **Middle/slight dorsiflexion** - easier, can progress faster
- **Reason**: Need to recover inner range strength into plantarflexion
- Lower position easier → faster progression
- Higher position struggle → but important to maintain

### Heel Wedge Removal

#### Timing

- **Delayed removal** compared to traditional protocols
- Traditional: Remove at 4, 6, 8 weeks
- **This protocol**:
  - First wedges: 6-7 weeks
  - Second: 8-9 weeks
  - Third: 10-11 weeks
- **Reason**: Minimize elongation risk
- **Parallel with rehab**: As removing wedges → introduce more dorsiflexion in rehab
- Align these two processes

### Tips for Early Strength Recovery

#### Scales Method (Stage 2 or Immobilization)

- Use scales + step at back
- Isometric hold in plantarflexion position
- Part of body weight on scales in front
- Scales show how much body weight they can hold
- Example: 80% body weight on loaded leg → progress to 100%
- Provides feedback on progress

## Running Progression

### Criteria to Start

- When **approaching Stage 3 targets**
- Not based on time

### Progression

#### Initial Running

- **Very slow shuffle** on flat ground
- **NOT AlterG** (not part of protocol)
- Some clubs use AlterG, but:
  - Doesn't save much time
  - Doesn't add much extra running earlier
  - Worry about elongation risk even with modified body weight

#### Volume Building

- **2-3 times per week** on usual training days
- Training block structure:
  1. Isometric work
  2. Run
  3. Plyometric prep before run
- **Build volume** initially

#### Intensity Progression

- Once approaching Stage 4 targets (more force, more strength)
- **End of Stage 3**: Start progressing intensity
- **Stage 4**: Progress intensity further

---

## Return to Sport Timeline

### General Population

- **18 weeks** to end of Stage 3
- **24 weeks** to end of Stage 4
- Further development ongoing

### Elite Athletes

- **Can be compressed**
- Current targets: 6 months (ambitious, not recommended)
- **Recommended**: 7-8 months for elite person (realistic)
- **NBA standard**: 12 months (sensible)
- Must respect tendon healing
- Depends on how initial stages go

---

## Prevention

### Current Limitations

#### Imaging (Ultrasound/UTC)

- **Shows pathology**, not capacity
- Can have healthy-looking tendon that still ruptures
- Case: Patient with healthy ultrasound → ruptured non-painful side during rehab
- **Mantra "normal tendon doesn't rupture"** - based on biased study (1997)
- Young athletes can rupture without extensive pathology

#### UTC Limitations

- Stiffness at specific region
- Must map entire tendon (don't know where it will rupture)
- Pathology may not be at injury site
- Hard to predict

### Future Direction: Tendon Stiffness

#### Research Focus

- Measure **tendon strain for given force**
- Lab measures available, but need sports context screening
- **Target**: Athletes who are strong (produce lots of force) but have compliant tendon
- **Intervention**: Increase tendon stiffness
- Potential preventative measure

#### Current Use in Sports

- Some teams use UTC
- More commonly: Standard ultrasound, MRI
- Some use elastography
- **Key point**: Need to differentiate pathology vs capacity
- Rupture happens when load exceeds capacity OR tendon is too weak

## Q&A Session

### Q: Protocol Timeline Clarification

**Q**: Each row says "+6 weeks" - is that from previous row?
**A**: Yes. Add up: 18 weeks to end of Stage 2, then 24 weeks to end of Stage 3. Stage 4 can be faster/compressed.

### Q: Boot Removal During Exercises

**Q**: In early phases, are they out of boot for isometrics only?
**A**: Yes. Boot on for everything else. Remove boot for exercises only. Walk to equipment with boot on → remove boot → do exercises → put boot back on.

### Q: Intrinsic Foot Activation

**Q**: How early do you introduce intrinsic muscle activation?
**A**: **Week 2** in immobilization period. Toe spreading, short foot exercises for proprioception. Foot swollen, no awareness after cast/boot.

### Q: Running Progression

**Q**: What does running progression look like? AlterG? Intervals?
**A**:

- Start when approaching Stage 3 targets
- Very slow shuffle on flat ground (not AlterG)
- 2-3 times per week
- Build volume first, then intensity
- AlterG not recommended (elongation risk, doesn't save time)

### Q: Anatomical Variations

**Q**: How do you treat someone with long Achilles/short gastro (like Kevin Durant) vs stout build differently?
**A**:

- Long Achilles = more compliant = more strain in daily life
- More fatigue accumulation
- **Rehab focus**:
  - Prevent elongation
  - Build fatigue resistance
  - Build strength and stiffness
- Elastic athletes (utilize stretch-shorten cycle well) → more prone to fatigue
- Would be interesting to profile athletes who rupture

### Q: Surgical Techniques

**Q**: Any comments on surgical techniques? Pearls?
**A**:

- No strong evidence one technique better than another
- Speed bridges well documented, but no clear winner
- **Key**: If you do good rehab, surgical technique probably doesn't matter
- **Pearl**: Make it as tight as possible - can always lengthen, harder to shorten

### Q: Blood Flow Restriction (BFR)

**Q**: Thoughts on BFR throughout rehab?
**A**:

- Could be useful in early stages
- Don't use it much currently
- Use Compex in early stages when calf not activating
- Could be additional add-on, but no research evidence
- Could add value in early stages

### Q: Other Modalities

**Q**: Aside from Compex, other modalities? Laser? Hyperbaric?
**A**:

- **Recovery important**: Maximize basic recovery elements
- **Collagen supplements**: Definitely use (everyone on them now)
- **Hyperbaric/Laser**: If available, why not? Won't harm, could help
- Not part of protocol per se, but fine as addition
- Especially for high-profile athletes (24/7 recovery focus)
- **Key**: Loading is most important - other things peripheral but fine if part of package

## Key Takeaways for Course Building

### Core Principles

1. **Elongation is the gateway** to return to sport - focus rehab here
2. **Aggressive loading early** in safe positions (plantarflexion)
3. **Cautious with immobilization** - don't remove boot too early
4. **Cautious with wedge removal** - delay compared to traditional
5. **Tendon is malleable** - can improve with right loading
6. **Force-based progression** - not time-based

### Critical Windows

- **0-16 weeks**: Elongation can be reversed
- **16-20 weeks**: Tendon becomes stiffer, harder to reverse elongation
- **After 16 weeks**: Very difficult to recover elongation

### Exercise Progression Logic

1. **Safe positions first** (plantarflexion)
2. **Build strength** before exposing to risk
3. **Parallel progression**: Wedge removal ↔ Dorsiflexion in rehab
4. **Split isometrics**: Top (hard) + middle (easier) positions
5. **Load before range**: Strengthen tendon before increasing range

### Measurement Focus

- **Direct elongation measure** (muscle-tendon junction)
- **Force targets** (body weight multiples)
- **Power metrics** (velocity, jump height)
- **Symmetry** (side-to-side comparison)

### Patient Education Points

- Rerupture rates are low (2-4%) regardless of surgery
- Elongation is the real problem
- Everyone gets some elongation - goal is to minimize it
- Right loading over right time = good outcome
- Tendon is malleable - can improve

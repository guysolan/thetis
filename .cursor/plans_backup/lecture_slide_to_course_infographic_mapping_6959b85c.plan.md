# Lecture Slide to Course Infographic Analysis

## Analysis Approach

Review each lecture slide (by timestamp) against the course content to identify:

1. Key concepts that need patient-friendly visualization
2. Gaps where infographics would enhance understanding
3. Priority based on educational value and course alignment

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on HIGH PRIORITY infographics first (11 items)
- Use Tintin style consistent with existing course images
- Reference `mike-and-doc.png` for character consistency
- Ensure all infographics are patient-friendly (avoid overly technical jargon)
- Match visual style to existing course images (tendon-strength-timeline.png, practical-life-week-10.png, etc.)

## Priority Updates Based on Existing Course Content

After reviewing existing course images, several priorities were adjusted:

### Downgraded to MEDIUM (redundancy with existing content)

- **12m30s** - Treatment Decision Factors (Week 2 already has `SurgeryVsNonSurgicalOutcomes.png`)
- **14m03s** - Surgery vs Non-Surgical Comparison (Week 2 already has comparison image)

## Placement Updates Based on Course Structure

Several infographics have been moved to better align with course timing:

- **34m30s (Protected Walking)** → Moved from Week 10 Day 0 to **Week 10 Day 4** (boot transition section)
- **39m22s (Rehab Protocol Timeline)** → Moved to **Week 9 Day 0 or Week 11 Day 0** (when patients are transitioning to active rehab)
- **40m00s (Phase 1 Exercises)** → Moved to **Week 9 Day 0 or Week 11 Day 0** (review/continuation timing)
- **44m22s (Phase 2 Goals)** → Moved to **Week 11 Day 0 or Week 12 Day 0** (when actively working on Phase 2)
- **44m55s (Phase 3 Progression)** → Moved to **Week 15 Day 0 or Week 20 Day 0** (progressive strengthening phase)
- **17m40s (Re-rupture Risk)** → Added **Week 26 Day 2** as additional placement (preventing re-rupture section)

These placements ensure infographics appear when the content is most relevant to the patient's recovery stage.

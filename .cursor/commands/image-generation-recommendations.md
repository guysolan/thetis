## Notes

- **Style consistency:** All images should match existing course style (Grant character, clean backgrounds, clear demonstrations)
- **Progression visuals:** Consider creating multi-panel images showing progression (e.g., two-leg → single-leg → deficit)
- **Assessment visuals:** Consider creating comparison images for symmetry/height assessments
- **Exercise form:** Focus on showing proper form, especially for exercises where form is critical (eccentric drops, jumps)

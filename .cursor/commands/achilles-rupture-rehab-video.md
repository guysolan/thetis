## Introduction

**Timestamp: 0:00-0:08**

In this video I'm going to discuss Achilles tendon ruptures, whether surgery is always necessary, and provide you with a comprehensive rehab plan.

---

## Anatomy

**Timestamp: 0:09-0:28**

The Achilles tendon connects your primary calf muscles (the gastrocnemius and soleus) to your calcaneus or heel bone. It is the strongest and thickest tendon in the human body and has been shown to experience loads up to four times body weight during walking and eight times body weight when running.

## Achilles Tendon Rupture

**Timestamp: 0:29-1:32**

An Achilles tendon rupture most commonly occurs from a sudden and forceful contraction of the calf muscles while the ankle is dorsiflexed, such as during sport-specific movements like forward acceleration, cutting, and jumping.

People describe the feeling as if they were kicked in the back of the leg or felt a popping or giving way sensation in their heel. Unfortunately, there aren't usually warning signs or symptoms leading up to the injury.

It typically presents with swelling and bruising, and there may be a palpable gap most frequently 2 to 6 cm above the heel bone.

In the physical therapy setting, specific clinical tests like the Thompson test help confirm the diagnosis. While the patient is lying on their stomach, the calf muscles are squeezed. Normally this results in ankle plantarflexion, but in cases of an Achilles rupture, no ankle movement will occur.

Imaging like diagnostic ultrasound and MRIs aren't required for a diagnosis, but they may be used if another injury is expected or to help monitor tendon healing during the rehab process.

## Surgery vs Non-Surgical Treatment

**Timestamp: 1:33-4:00**

Surgery has long been considered the primary treatment option for Achilles tendon ruptures. However, current research now recognizes non-surgical management as a viable option as well.

### Research Evidence

**2022 Multicenter Randomized Control Trial:**

- Over 500 patients randomly assigned to either non-operative treatment, open repair surgery, or minimally invasive surgery
- At 12 months, self-reported symptoms and functional limitations, as well as the overall incidence of serious adverse events, were similar in all three groups
- Although uncommon overall, reruptures did occur more often with non-operative treatment
- Sensory nerve injuries were more common following surgery

**2019 Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis:**

- Examined non-surgical management versus surgery in over 15,000 people across 29 different studies

**Findings for Non-Surgical Management:**

- About four people per 100 treated will rupture their Achilles tendon by 2 years
- About two people per 100 treated will have complications over 2 years (such as an infection or nerve injury)

**Findings for Surgery:**

- About two people per 100 treated will experience a rerupture by 2 years
- About five people per 100 treated will have complications over 2 years

### Key Points

Both surgery and non-surgical management have been shown to lead to similar functional outcomes. You'll have to weigh the potential benefits and risks to determine which option is most appropriate for you and your goals.

**Non-Surgical Management Benefits:**

- Avoiding surgery and its costs
- Lower risk of complications
- **Downside:** Slightly greater risk of rerupture

**Surgery Benefits:**

- Slightly lower risk of rerupture
- **Downside:** Greater risk of complications and higher cost depending on insurance

**Decision Factors:**

- Elite athletes looking to return to sport as soon as possible: Higher chance of rerupture might not be acceptable
- Non-athletes who only need to resume daily activities: Non-surgical management may be appropriate

Ultimately, the decision should be a collaborative approach with your doctor, physical therapist, and any other relevant healthcare providers.

## Rehab Overview

**Timestamp: 4:01-5:21**

Whether you choose surgery or not, the rehabilitation process looks very similar. The goal is to address specific deficits such as those related to calf strength, endurance, and power, since these have been shown to persist on the injured side for up to 2 years following an Achilles tendon rupture.

This will be accomplished by following a step-wise progression of exercises and activities that gradually load the Achilles tendon more over time.

**Example Progression:**

- **Early:** Unweighted seated heel raise (loads Achilles tendon very little)
- **Later:** Single-leg multi-directional hopping (highly loads Achilles tendon)

### Rehab Plan Structure

The rehab plan consists of **five overlapping phases**:

1. Controlled mobilization
2. Normalize walking
3. Advanced strength exercises
4. Energy storage and release
5. Return to sport

**Important:** Guidelines for when to start and progress exercises are provided, but surgical precautions, symptoms, function, etc. will influence these factors. Therefore, you should speak to your surgeon or physical therapist before beginning any new exercises.

---

## Phase 1: Controlled Mobilization

**Timestamp: 5:24-8:35**

### Boot and Immobilization

Immediately following the injury, you will wear what is called a Cam Walker Boot. Depending on your doctor's recommendations, crutches or another assisted device might be necessary early on.

Inside the boot, you will have heel lifts or wedges that allow for progressive adjustment of ankle dorsiflexion.

**Key Principle:**

- Exercises/activities/positions that involve more **plantarflexion** will place **less stress** on the Achilles tendon
- **Dorsiflexion** (movement where the angle between your foot and shin decreases) will generally place **more stress** on the Achilles tendon

Therefore, limiting the amount of dorsiflexion is crucial during the early stages of rehab as it helps promote tendon healing and minimize tendon elongation, which has the potential to lead to worse outcomes.

**Protocol:**

- Most protocols typically start in about **30° of plantarflexion**
- Gradually reduce this amount until the boot is removed (around **weeks 6 to 8 or longer**)
- Even after transitioning back to regular shoes, you will likely continue to use a heel lift
- **University of Delaware recommendation:** Use a 1/4 inch heel lift in both shoes for up to 11 weeks following the injury

### Phase 1 Exercises (Starting Around Week 2)

#### 1. Plantarflexion Strength

**Primary Option: Single Leg Seated Heel Raise**

- Without weight
- Lift your heel as high as possible with an emphasis on squeezing your calf muscles at the top
- Earlier on, these are performed with a heel elevated on a wedge to limit the amount of dorsiflexion you move through

**Other Options:**

- Wrap a light resistance band around the ball of your foot and perform ankle plantarflexion for reps or hold for time
- If performing repetitions, limit how much dorsiflexion you move into
- Perform calf isometrics throughout the day: gently push the ball of your foot into the ground at a tolerable effort level (can also be done while wearing the boot)

**Programming:**

- Aim for 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 25 repetitions
- Or 15 to 45 second holds for the isometrics
- Depending on your tolerance, you may perform these 1 to 3 times per day

#### 2. Foot and Ankle Movements

- Towel curls
- Short foot exercise
- Other foot and ankle movements

**Purpose:** Help minimize muscle atrophy and disuse of the surrounding muscles

#### 3. Other Lower Body Exercises

While wearing the boot, you can also perform other lower body exercises such as:

- Leg extensions
- Hamstring curls

**If cleared for full weight-bearing:**

- Squatting variations like a squat to a box

**Important:** Decisions about when to stop wearing the boot, removing the heel lifts, or what exercises you perform will vary from case to case. Follow the recommendations provided by your surgeon or healthcare provider.

---

## Phase 2: Normalize Walking

**Timestamp: 8:40-9:33**

As you transition out of the boot, one of the first goals is to be able to walk unassisted without a limp.

### Exercises

#### 1. Single Leg Balance

- Stand on one leg on flat ground
- Try not to let your other leg touch the ground
- If you need to make it easier, use your hands for assistance
- Work up to **three sets of 60 seconds**

#### 2. Retro Walking (Walking Backward)

- Fancy name for walking backward
- Helpful drill for loading the Achilles tendon and working on eccentric calf strength
- **Easier variation:** Hold onto an object, step backward slowly, lowering your heel to the ground, then returning to the starting position

**Important:** These exercises and other activities should be performed while wearing shoes and a heel lift unless instructed otherwise by your surgeon or physical therapist.

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Strength Exercises

**Timestamp: 9:37-14:23**

**Goal:** Continue gradually loading the Achilles tendon and further strengthen your calves and surrounding muscles.

**Critical Safety Note:** The greatest risk of rerupture is typically during the transition out of the boot and up to about the **3-month mark**. Therefore, it is important to avoid faster and quicker movements during this period, since these place higher loads through the Achilles tendon.

### Heel Raises: The Most Important Exercise

The most important exercise in your recovery will be a heel raise.

#### Seated Heel Raises

**Progression:**

- Once you can perform **three sets of 25 slow and controlled reps on a single leg on flat ground**, you should add external load
- Use: dumbbell, kettlebell, Smith machine, or seated calf raise machine
- Perform for **3 to 4 sets of 6 to 15 repetitions**

**Other Advanced Options:**

- Weighted double leg seated heel raises on the floor or from a deficit
- Use: barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, Smith machine, or seated calf raise machine

#### Standing Heel Raises

Since the rehab phases overlap, standing heel raises can usually be initiated once you can walk without an assistive device.

**Progression Based on Achilles Tendon Demands:**

1. **Two legs on flat ground**
   - Once you can perform **three sets of 25 repetitions**, progress to single leg

2. **Single leg**
   - Work your way up to **three sets of 15 repetitions** through your full range of motion

3. **Single leg heel raises off the edge of a step or object**
   - Goal: **three sets of 15 repetitions**

4. **Add external load**
   - Aim for **3 to 4 sets of 6 to 15 repetitions**

**Other Knee-Straight Options:**

- Smith machine standing heel raise
- Standing heel raise machine
- Leg press
- Can be performed double leg or single leg
- Can be performed with or without a deficit

**If progressing from two legs to one leg is too challenging:**

- Try performing a heel raise in a staggered stance position

#### Milestone Recommendation

You should be able to perform a **single leg seated heel raise with 50% of your body weight for greater than 20 repetitions by the third month**.

**Why this matters:** Research demonstrates a correlation between this ability and the ability to perform one single leg standing heel raise, which has been shown to be significantly related to patient-reported outcomes after an Achilles tendon rupture.

#### Programming

- Aim to perform a minimum of **1 to 2 heel raise exercises 2 to 3 days per week**
- **Example:** Seated heel raises on Monday and Friday, standing progression on Wednesday

**Important:** Even though double leg heel raises are presented as options, prioritize single leg variations since deficits can persist on the injured side for up to 2 years following the injury.

**One of these deficits is heel raise height**, which can impact the long-term recovery of ankle biomechanics. In the clinical setting, heel raise can easily be assessed with a tape measure and can be compared to the non-injured side.

**Tempo:** Emphasize a slow and controlled tempo, trying to lift your heel as high as possible with each repetition.

### Other Phase 3 Considerations

#### 1. Continue Lower Body Exercises

- Continue to perform and progress exercises like leg extension and hamstring curl mentioned earlier
- Start incorporating other lower body movements: squat and deadlift variations

**Lower Body Strength Progression Example:**

1. Body weight squat
2. Low step up
3. High step up
4. Low step down
5. High step down

#### 2. Aerobic Exercise

- Good time to incorporate aerobic exercises like riding a stationary bike
- Helps maintain or improve cardiorespiratory fitness

#### 3. Calf Stretches

- You can eventually perform calf stretches
- **Aggressive stretching is not recommended**, especially early on
- Exercises like step downs and deficit heel raises will help restore your dorsiflexion range of motion

---

## Phase 4: Energy Storage & Release

**Timestamp: 14:26-17:59**

This includes jumping, landing, plyometrics, and exercises that prioritize a faster rate of loading. You will also start running during this phase.

### When to Begin

**Example Criteria (Karen Silvernagle & University of Delaware):**

- At least **12 weeks post-injury**
- Be able to perform **five single leg heel raises at 90% of your available height** (based on your injured side)

If you can achieve these criteria, you can begin exercises like:

- Double leg rebound heel raises
- Double leg vertical jumps
- Double leg hops in place

### Plyometric Progressions

There are limitless ways to progress plyometrics, but here are three options based on Achilles tendon loading:

#### Option 1: Hopping Progression

1. Double leg hops in place
2. Side to side
3. Forward and backward
4. Work through the same progression but on a single leg

#### Option 2: Vertical Jump Progression

1. **Level 1:** Sub maximal vertical jump on two legs
2. **Level 2:** Double leg maximal vertical jump
3. **Level 3:** Drop jump (step off an elevated surface, land on two legs, then quickly jump up as high as possible)
4. **Level 4:** Single leg sub maximal vertical jump
5. **Level 5:** Single leg maximal vertical jump
6. **Level 6:** Single leg drop jump

#### Option 3: Horizontal Jump Progression

1. Sub maximal horizontal jump on two legs (build up to about 80% effort)
2. Maximal horizontal jump on two legs
3. Single leg submaximal jump
4. Single leg maximal jump
5. Try and stick your landing during each repetition

**Making Exercises Easier:**

- Not leaving the ground
- Jumping less high
- Not jumping as far

### Programming

**When first starting:**

- Lower intensity double leg hops in place for **10 to 15 seconds**
- And/or double leg submaximal vertical jumps for **3 to 5 repetitions**
- **1 to 2 days per week**

**As tolerance improves:**

- Gradually increase volume and intensity

**Eventually build up to:**

- **Hopping exercises:** 2 to 4 sets of 30 to 60 seconds
- **Jumping progressions:** 2 to 4 sets of 4 to 10 repetitions
- **2 to 3 days per week**

### Running Protocol

There is no universally accepted protocol following an Achilles tendon rupture, but here's one example from the University of Delaware that involves the use of a treadmill:

- Starts with **walk to jog intervals**
- Progresses to **continuous jogging**
- Before slowly ramping up to **faster running speeds**

**Guidelines:**

- Rest at least **1 to 2 days between sessions**
- Only progress levels if you have **no soreness during or after**
- **If you experience soreness during:** Drop down a level
- **If you experience soreness afterward:** Stay at the same level the next session

---

## Phase 5: Return to Sport

**Timestamp: 18:04-19:16**

You'll perform more sport-specific movements and gradually increase the intensity, volume, and complexity of your training.

**Example:** Running on the treadmill will eventually progress to sprinting, cutting, and change of direction drills.

### Return to Sport Criteria

There's currently no consensus on what objective criteria you must meet before returning to your sport. However, some recommendations suggest you demonstrate ankle plantarflexion strength, hopping, and jumping tasks **greater or equal to 85% of the uninjured leg**.

**Example:** If you can perform 20 single leg heel raises with 20 lbs on your uninjured side, you should be able to perform at least 17 repetitions with the same weight on your injured side.

### Return Process

When you are clear to return to sport, understand that this process is a continuum that usually takes place over several months:

1. **Modified practice** and sport-specific drills
2. Progress back to **full participation**
3. **Final stage:** Perform at or above your pre-injury level

### Return to Play Rates

Based on numerous studies, the rate of return to play typically ranges from about **70 to 80%** across various sports.

## Putting It All Together

**Timestamp: 19:28-21:39**

### Three Final Points

#### 1. Overlapping Phases

The rehab plan includes five overlapping phases. This means you aren't in one phase today and another phase tomorrow.

**Example:** Your physical therapist may have you start more advanced strength exercises even while you are still working on normalizing your walking. Similarly, even if you are clear to begin jumping exercises, it is essential to continue performing the heel raises and other strength movements from the previous phase.

#### 2. Progress is Individual

Your progress will be determined by your symptoms and function until your precautions are lifted by your surgeon or physical therapist. This varies from case to case.

**Example:** Aaron Rodgers returned to some football activities only 11 weeks after surgery. However, not everyone will experience this rate of rehab. If you are older and less active, you may progress slower and your overall recovery may take longer. **That's okay.**

**Important:** Keep exercises and activities tolerable, follow your precautions, and focus on addressing your specific deficits.

#### 3. Set Realistic Expectations

If your goal is to return to your previous level of function or higher, I cannot stress enough the importance of:

- Following a structured rehab plan
- Staying consistent for **at least 12 months or longer**

---

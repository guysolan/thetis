The project will involve creating 7 distinct blog pages, each focusing on a specific phase of the ATR recovery timeline (Weeks 0-1, 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-25, 26+).

### Key Resources to Leverage:

- **Timeline Data:** `apps/website/src/content/FAQs/achilles-rupture-timeline-content.ts`
- **International Research:** `apps/website/src/components/research/timeline-by-country/data.ts`
- **Product Guides:** `apps/achilles-rupture/src/content/articles/six-essential-items-to-make-achilles-rupture-recovery-easier.mdx`
- **Medical Research:** Articles on VTE (blood thinners) and re-rupture prevention.

### Structural Requirements for Each Post:

- **SEO Headers:** H1 for main title, H2 for major sections, H3 for sub-points.
- **Graphics:** Mermaid diagrams for flows, placeholders for product images.
- **Product Integration:** Strategic placement of Night Splint, EVENup, and other recovery aids.
- **Common Issues:** Dedicated sections for sleep, gait, and psychological factors.

### Execution Steps:

1.  **Phase 1 (Weeks 0-3):** Focus on the acute phase and treatment decisions.
2.  **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-12):** Focus on the "boot life," sleeping solutions, and the transition to shoes.
3.  **Phase 3 (Weeks 13+):** Focus on intensive rehabilitation and return to sport.

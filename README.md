# Why

There are lots of things I need to keep track of and it is nice to not keep it all in my head. Additionally, there are many repeatable tasks that I can automate.

The solution is either:

- Build a custom solution to do:
  - Basic stock management
  - Compile knowledge of suppliers and proceedures
  - Automate repeatable tasks like getting VAT
  - Use midday.ai to manage finances

My worries about building a custom solution are:

- It'll take ages to build
- I won't learn the accounting and stock-management skills baked into industry standards
- I'll have to keep maintaining the custom solution
  
- Use industry standards to do accounting and stock-mangement:
  - Quickbooks
  - Link My Books
  - A2X

My worry with the industry standards is that I'll spend a lot of time learning how to use them, they will be overkill for my needs and I will have to spend more time and money customising them to my needs.

## Accounting

It takeas a long time to get everything together. It would be great to automate collecting the:

- Amazon settlements
- Shopify orders
- Paypal transactions
- Revolut statements
- Expenses
- Wise Statements

## Stock

Keeping track of all the stock is a headache. Every purchase I make should add and remove items from the stock. This helps to:

- Plan manufacturing
- Calculate profit
- Not run out of stock
- Not sell items that I don't have

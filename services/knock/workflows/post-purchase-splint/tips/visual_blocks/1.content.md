Hi there,

Quick tips to get the most from your Thetis Splint:

**When to use it**
- **Night time:** Replace your boot while sleeping — lighter, more breathable, same 30° protection.
- **Rest:** Use when resting during the day (not walking or standing).
- **Important:** Do not walk or stand in the splint. Wait at least 2 weeks post-surgery before use — check with your surgeon.

**Setup**
- **Crutches by the bed:** Store them upside-down (grips on the floor) so they're stable and easy to reach at night.
- **Straps:** Snug but not tight — support without cutting off circulation.
- **Toes down:** Keep your foot in the pointed-down position (30° plantarflexion). That keeps the tendon ends together and supports healing.

**Bonus**
- You can shower without the boot — the splint keeps your foot protected at the right angle while you wash. No dirt in bed.

We'll check in again in a few days.

Hi there,

Thank you for your Thetis Splint ({{ data.order_number }}).

Your splint is designed for Achilles rupture recovery: lightweight (200g), 30° healing angle, and built for sleep and rest so you can wake up better rested. No more sleeping in the heavy boot — many patients say it made a massive difference to getting a good night's rest.

We'll send setup tips in a few days once it's had time to arrive. Reply anytime if you have questions.

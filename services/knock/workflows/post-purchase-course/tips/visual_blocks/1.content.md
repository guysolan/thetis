Hi there,

A few ways to get the most from your Thetis Course:

**Start here**
- Log in at [course.thetismedical.com]({{ vars.course_url }}) with the email you ordered with if you haven't yet.
- **Emergency care** and **Week 1 checklist** are the most important early lessons: toes down 24/7, what's normal vs when to get help, and your first clinic visit.

**Work through at your pace**
- The course follows your recovery: emergency → early treatment → boot phase → transition → physio → return to sport. Use the checklist and lesson list to find what fits your stage.

**One rule to remember**
- Keep your foot pointed down (plantarflexion) unless your clinician says otherwise. That keeps the tendon ends together and supports healing.

We'll check in again in a few days.

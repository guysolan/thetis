Hi there,

Thank you for your Thetis Course ({{ data.order_number }}).

You now have the full week-by-week recovery guide — from emergency care and the first week through the boot phase, physio, and return to sport. Everything in one place, when you need it.

Log in at [course.thetismedical.com]({{ vars.course_url }}) with the email you used to order. Once you're in, start with **Emergency care** and **Week 1 checklist** — they set the foundation (toes down 24/7, what's normal vs urgent, and your first follow-up).

Reply anytime if you have questions.

The Thetis Medical Team

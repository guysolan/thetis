Hi there,

Around weeks 4-6, many people start preparing for physiotherapy and controlled loading. This is an exciting phase — you're moving from protection to active recovery.

Timing varies a lot by protocol (and if you had surgery, you may have specific wound restrictions early on) — follow your clinician/physio's guidance.

## Preparing for Physio

**What to expect:**
Physiotherapy will start with slow, controlled exercises. The early focus is usually on:

- **Safe loading** with your foot pointed down
- **Building strength** gradually
- **Improving mobility** without overstretching

Your physiotherapist will guide you through specific exercises based on your protocol and progress.

## General Safety Reminders

As you start moving more, remember:

- **Early exercises are usually slow and controlled** with the foot pointed down
- **Avoid fast movements** or stretching with toes up — these can damage the healing tendon
- **Swelling and stiffness are common** — steady progress matters more than speed
- **Follow your physio's guidance** — they know your specific situation

## The Safe Loading Principle

During early recovery, your tendon is still healing. Controlled, slow loading in a shortened position (foot pointed down) stimulates healing without overstretching. Fast, eccentric loading (toes up during movement) puts dangerous stretch forces on the tendon before it's strong enough.

This is why your exercises will start slowly and build gradually.

## Remember

Always follow your clinician or physiotherapist's guidance. They know your specific situation and can tailor exercises to your needs.

You're making great progress. Keep going.

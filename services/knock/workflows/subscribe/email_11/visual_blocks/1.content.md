Hi there,

Around week 7, many people start thinking about life after the boot. Whether you're still a few weeks away or getting close, it helps to know what's coming.

## Preparing for Boot Removal

**What to expect:**

Boot removal usually happens around weeks 10-12 (timing varies by protocol). When you first walk without your boot, it will feel strange — your ankle is stiff, your calf is weak, and your brain isn't used to trusting that leg yet.

**Getting ready:**

- **Supportive shoes** — get a pair ready with good arch support and a slightly raised heel
- **Heel lifts** — many people use 0.5-1cm heel lifts initially to reduce strain on the tendon
- **Start with short distances** — your first walks will be brief and careful

## What Shoes to Get Ready

Look for:

- **Firm heel counter** — supports the back of your ankle
- **Slight heel raise** — reduces stretch on the tendon
- **Good arch support** — helps with stability
- **Avoid flat shoes** for now — sandals, flip-flops, and ballet flats put more strain on the tendon

Running shoes or supportive trainers usually work well for the first few weeks out of the boot.

## The Transition Phase

The gap between boot and normal walking is bigger than most people expect. Your tendon has healed, but it's not yet strong enough for full normal activity. This is why:

- **Walking forces are 3x higher** without a boot than with one
- **Gradual transition** matters more than speed
- **Physio exercises** help build the strength you need

Hi there,

Around weeks 2-3, many people start thinking about returning to work. Whether you have a desk job or a physical job, there are practical considerations that can help make the transition smoother.

## Desk Jobs

**What to consider:**

- **Elevation** — can you elevate your foot while working? This is still important for reducing swelling
- **Comfort** — sitting for long periods can be uncomfortable with a boot
- **Commuting** — getting to and from work on crutches takes longer and is more tiring
- **Fatigue** — recovery is exhausting; you may need to work shorter days initially

**Tips:**

- Talk to your employer about working from home if possible (at least initially)
- If in the office, set up a space where you can elevate your foot
- Take regular breaks to move around (safely, with crutches)
- Be realistic about your energy levels — recovery takes a lot out of you

## Physical Jobs

**What to consider:**

- **Weight-bearing restrictions** — you may still be non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing
- **Safety** — working on your feet with a boot and crutches can be dangerous
- **Timeline** — returning to physical work usually takes longer than desk work
- **Modified duties** — can your employer provide light duties?

**Important:**

- Don't rush back to physical work — your safety and recovery come first
- Follow your clinician's guidance on when it's safe to return
- Consider modified duties or a phased return
- Be honest with your employer about your limitations

## Communication with Your Employer

**Be proactive:**

- Contact your employer early to discuss your situation
- Provide medical documentation if needed
- Discuss options: work from home, modified duties, phased return, or extended leave
- Be realistic about timelines — recovery takes time

**Know your rights:**

- In many places, employers must provide reasonable accommodations
- You may be entitled to sick leave or disability benefits
- Check your local employment laws and company policies

## Timeline Expectations

**Realistic timelines:**

- **Desk jobs:** Some people return after 2-4 weeks (often with work-from-home options)
- **Physical jobs:** Usually 8-12 weeks minimum, often longer
- **Everyone is different** — your timeline depends on your job, your recovery, and your protocol

Don't compare yourself to others. Your recovery is unique.

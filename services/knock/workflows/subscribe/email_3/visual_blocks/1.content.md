Hi there,

Within a week or two, you should expect an appointment with a specialist. Clinics are busy, and it can feel overwhelming — you might forget to ask the questions that matter most.

## Why This Appointment Matters

This is when you'll get your treatment plan confirmed — whether you're going surgical or non-surgical, what your boot protocol will be, and what to expect over the next few weeks. Having your questions ready helps you get the information you need.

## Questions to Ask Your Specialist

Write these down and bring them with you:

**About Your Diagnosis:**

- Is this a confirmed rupture? Do I need an ultrasound?
- If you measured a gap (e.g., 4 cm), does it close when my foot is pointed down? What does that mean for my treatment plan?

**About Your Treatment Protocol:**

- What ankle angle should I be in (how pointed down) and for how long?
- Am I non-weight-bearing, partial, or weight-bearing as tolerated?
- When do I start physiotherapy, and what are the early goals?

**About Safety:**

- Will I get blood thinner (VTE prophylaxis)? For how long?
- What symptoms should trigger urgent help?
- What should I do after hours if I can't reach you?

**About Daily Life:**

- Can anything be removed to wash/shower, or is it waterproof cover only?
- Can you provide a work note/sick note today?
- How do I manage pain at home?
- What activities should I avoid?

Hi there,

If you're around the end of Week 1 (or early Week 2), you've already handled a lot. This early phase is often the hardest emotionally because everything is new, and you don't know what's normal.

## What's Usually Normal in Week 1

It's common to experience:

- **Swelling and bruising** that increase over the first 1-3 days (this is your body's normal response)
- **A heavy or tight feeling** in your ankle
- **Disrupted sleep** from the cast/splint/boot
- **Anxiety or frustration** — this injury changes everything overnight, and that's hard

Feeling worried is normal. You've had a sudden injury that changes everything. Having a clear plan makes it easier.

## Your Week 1 Routine

Keep it simple:

- **Elevate** your ankle above heart level as much as possible
- **Protect the tendon** 24/7 — no stretching, no barefoot testing
- **Take any prescribed blood thinners** as directed (they reduce clot risk)
- **Move carefully** on crutches and slow down on stairs
- **Know the red flags** — if you see signs of blood clots (calf swelling, chest pain, breathlessness) or circulation problems (numb/blue toes), get urgent help

Hi there,

If you've been moved into a walking boot, this is where the real healing happens. The boot protects your tendon while allowing controlled loading. Understanding how it works helps you follow your protocol correctly. (If you're still in a cast/splint, follow your clinician's instructions — this will still be relevant soon.)

## Boot Basics

**Your walking boot:**

- Keeps your ankle in the correct position (pointed down) while your tendon heals
- Many protocols have you wear it 24/7 for several weeks (timing varies)
- Follow your protocol exactly — don't rush ahead

**The angle system:**

- You start at maximum angle (all wedges in for Aircast, or hinge locked for VACOped)
- Your clinician will tell you when to reduce the angle
- Never adjust without instruction

## The Night-Time Challenge

Many people struggle to sleep with a walking boot. It's bulky, uncomfortable, and can make it hard to get proper rest. Around 80% of patients struggle with sleep during this phase.

If this is you, our [Thetis Achilles Rupture Splint](https://thetismedical.com/achilles-rupture-splint) keeps your ankle in a safe pointed-down position while you sleep, without the bulk of a walking boot. It also allows you to properly wash your foot. Many patients find it makes those first few weeks much more bearable.

## Understanding Your Protocol

Different protocols have different timelines and progressions. The important thing is following yours consistently.

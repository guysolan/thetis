Hi there,

Around week 8, you're likely making good progress and feeling stronger. This is an exciting phase, but it's also when rerupture risk is highest. Understanding how to prevent rerupture—and recognizing warning signs—can help keep you safe.

## Why Rerupture Risk Is Higher Now

At this stage:

- **Your tendon has healed** but isn't yet fully strong
- **You're moving more** and may feel confident
- **The temptation to push** can be strong
- **But the tendon isn't ready** for high forces yet

This combination makes weeks 8-12 a critical period for preventing rerupture.

## Common Causes of Rerupture

**What to avoid:**

- **Sudden, forceful movements** — jumping, running, or explosive movements
- **Stretching with toes up** — this puts dangerous tension on the healing tendon
- **Removing wedges too early** — this allows the tendon to stretch before it's strong enough
- **Overdoing exercises** — too much, too soon
- **Slipping or falling** — be extra careful on wet or uneven surfaces

## Warning Signs to Watch For

**Contact your medical team immediately if you experience:**

- **Sudden, sharp pain** in the back of your ankle or calf
- **A "pop" or "snap" sensation** — especially during activity
- **Sudden inability to push off** with your toes
- **Swelling that increases** after activity
- **Bruising** that appears suddenly
- **Feeling like something "gave way"**

Don't ignore these signs. Early intervention can prevent a full rerupture.

## Safe Progression Principles

**Gradual is key:**

- **Follow your protocol** — your clinician knows your specific situation
- **Progress slowly** — small increases in activity, not big jumps
- **Listen to your body** — if something hurts, stop
- **Build strength gradually** — tendon strength takes time to develop
- **Avoid high-impact activities** until cleared by your clinician

**The 10% rule:**

- Increase activity by no more than 10% per week
- This applies to walking distance, exercise intensity, and activity duration
- Slow and steady wins the race

## When to Slow Down vs Push Forward

**Slow down if:**

- You have increased pain or swelling after activity
- You feel unstable or unsteady
- You're experiencing new symptoms
- You're exhausted or fatigued

**You can continue if:**

- Pain and swelling are stable or improving
- You feel strong and stable
- Your clinician has cleared you for the activity
- You're progressing gradually

**When in doubt, slow down.** It's better to take an extra week than to risk rerupture.

## The Long-Term View

Recovery from an Achilles rupture is a marathon, not a sprint. The early weeks are about protection. The middle weeks (where you are now) are about gradual strengthening. The later weeks are about returning to full activity.

Each phase has its own goals and risks. You're doing well—keep going safely.

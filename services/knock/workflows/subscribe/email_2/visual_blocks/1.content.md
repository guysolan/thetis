Hi there,

The early days are about one thing: protection. Your tendon needs to heal, and the best way to help it is to keep it shortened and safe.

## The Golden Rule: Keep Your Foot Pointed Down

This is the most important thing you need to know right now. Keeping your ankle in a tiptoe position (toes down, what clinicians call plantarflexion) pushes the two ends of the ruptured tendon together. This allows the tendon to heal properly.

**What this means:**

- Keep your ankle pointed down at all times
- Avoid any movement that brings your toes up toward your shin (dorsiflexion)
- Do not test the tendon or try to stretch it
- Keep your boot or splint on unless your clinician specifically says otherwise

## Other Day 1 Essentials

- **Elevate your ankle** above heart level as much as possible — this helps reduce swelling
- **Take it slow** — you're on crutches for a reason. Move carefully, especially on stairs
- **Follow your weight-bearing instructions** — whether you're non-weight-bearing, partial, or weight-bearing as tolerated

## When to Get Urgent Help

If you experience any of these, seek urgent care immediately:

- New calf swelling, pain, or tenderness (possible blood clot)
- Chest pain, breathlessness, or coughing blood (possible lung clot)
- Numb, blue, or pale toes
- A new "pop" after a fall with sudden worsening pain
- Severe increasing pressure or pain in your cast/boot

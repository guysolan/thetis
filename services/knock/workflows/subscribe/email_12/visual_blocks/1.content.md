Hi there,

Pain management is one of the biggest concerns in the early days after an Achilles rupture. Understanding what's normal versus what needs immediate attention can help reduce anxiety and ensure you get help when you need it.

## What's Normal Pain?

In the first few days, you can expect:

- **Moderate to severe pain** — this is normal, especially when moving or if the foot drops
- **Pain that improves** with elevation and rest
- **Pain that responds** to prescribed pain medication
- **Swelling and bruising** — these are normal signs of injury

## When to Contact Your Medical Team

Contact your medical team immediately if you experience:

- **Severe, unrelenting pain** that doesn't improve with medication and elevation
- **Sudden increase in pain** or new sharp pain
- **Signs of infection** — increasing redness, warmth, pus, or fever
- **Numbness or tingling** that's getting worse
- **Severe swelling** that's getting worse despite elevation
- **Chest pain or shortness of breath** — could indicate a blood clot (medical emergency)

## Safe Pain Management Strategies

**Elevation:**
- Keep your foot elevated above heart level as much as possible
- Use pillows or a wedge — the more comfortable you are, the more you'll elevate
- Elevate even when sleeping (if possible)

**Ice:**
- Apply ice packs wrapped in a towel for 15-20 minutes, several times a day
- Don't apply ice directly to skin
- Ice helps reduce swelling, which can help with pain

**Medication:**
- Take pain medication as prescribed by your medical team
- Don't wait until pain is severe — stay ahead of it
- If medication isn't working, contact your medical team

**Rest:**
- Avoid unnecessary movement in the first few days
- Keep your foot pointed down (toes down) — this reduces tension on the tendon

## The Mental Side

Pain can be exhausting, both physically and mentally. It's normal to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or frustrated. If you're struggling, talk to someone — your medical team, family, or friends. You don't have to manage this alone.

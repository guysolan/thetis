Hi there,

By now, you've likely had or are about to have your follow-up appointment where you'll discuss treatment options. This can feel like a big decision, but both surgical and non-surgical approaches can lead to good outcomes when done properly.

## Understanding Your Options

**Surgery vs. Non-Surgical:**
Both paths can work. The choice often depends on:

- Your tendon gap size and whether it closes when your foot is pointed down
- Your age, activity level, and preferences
- Your surgeon's experience and protocol

The key is following the right protocol for whichever path you choose.

## Key Questions to Understand Your Plan

Make sure you understand:

- **What is my tendon gap size?** Does it close with toes pointed down? What does that mean for my treatment?
- **What protocol are you following?** Boot angles, timeline, weight-bearing progression — get the details
- **When do I start physio?** What are the early goals and milestones?

## The Importance of Protocol

Whether you go surgical or non-surgical, following the right protocol matters. The boot angles, weight-bearing progression, and physio timing all need to be coordinated properly.

## Remember

There's no single "right" answer for everyone. The best treatment is the one that fits your situation and that you can follow consistently. Trust your clinician, but also make sure you understand the plan.

Take care,

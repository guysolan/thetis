Hi there,

Week 1 is hard enough without struggling with basic daily tasks. A few simple items and tips can make a huge difference to your comfort and safety right now.

## Essential Items for Early Recovery

**Must-haves:**

- **Leg elevation wedge or pillow** — more comfortable than stacking regular pillows and helps reduce swelling
- **Shower stool** — if you feel unsteady, this is a game-changer for bathroom safety

**Worth considering:**

- **Small backpack** — carrying things on crutches is awkward
- **Lightweight splint for sleep** — if you're struggling to sleep in your boot (especially after cast removal), some patients find a lightweight splint helpful. It keeps your ankle protected at the correct angle while being much lighter and more comfortable than the boot. Our [Thetis Achilles Rupture Splint](https://thetismedical.com/achilles-rupture-splint) is designed specifically for this, but check with your surgeon first to ensure it's appropriate for your protocol.

## Safe Mobility Tips

Moving around on crutches takes practice. Here are some basics:

- **Stairs:** Go up with your good leg first, down with your injured leg first ("up with the good, down with the bad")
- **Bathroom safety:** Use a non-slip mat, keep floors dry, and store crutches upside-down against the wall (grips on floor)
- **Take it slow** — rushing increases your risk of falling

## Setting Up Your Space

Make your home safer and easier to navigate:

- Move frequently used items to waist height (no bending or reaching)
- Clear pathways of clutter
- Keep crutches nearby when you're sitting
- Set up a comfortable spot for elevation with everything you need within reach

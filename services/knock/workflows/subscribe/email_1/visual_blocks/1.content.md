Hi there,

First of all, sorry about your injury. Achilles ruptures aren't fun and recovery isn't quick.

To do everything we can to get you back to work and sport as quickly as possible, we work with surgeons and physios to create various resources to help.

This email course helps give you quick bite-sized summaries, but there are further resources on our website at [thetismedical.com/FAQs](https://thetismedical.com/FAQs).

Over the next several weeks, we will send you short, practical emails that cover what to do in the early days, how to talk to your specialist, and how to recover safely and comfortably.

For now there is just one rule, keep your foot in tiptoe position. This pushes the ends of the tendon together and allows the tendon to heal.

## Want more detail?

If you want the full week-by-week plan (checklists, what’s normal vs urgent, and what to do next), our [Achilles Rupture Recovery Course](https://thetismedical.com/course) lays it out clearly.

We'll be in touch soon.

The Thetis Medical Team

p.s. If you're wondering why we're called Thetis - it is the name of Achilles' mother in Greek Mythology.

Hi there,

Week 10 — you've come a long way. Progress can feel slow day to day, but when you look back, you've made real progress. That's worth acknowledging.

## Where You Are Now

Around week 10, many people are:

- **Out of the boot** (or getting close — timing varies)
- **Starting to walk** more normally
- **Building strength** through physiotherapy
- **Feeling more confident** in your recovery

This is a good time to zoom out and see how far you've come.

## Focus Areas for the Next Phase

**Keep building gradually:**

- **Strength and balance** — these take time to rebuild
- **Walking properly** — focus on heel-to-toe pattern, not rushing
- **Following your rehab plan** — consistency matters more than speed

**Avoid rushing:**

- **Don't jump back into high-impact activity** too soon
- **Listen to your body** — some stiffness and swelling is normal
- **Trust the process** — recovery takes time, but you're on the right track

## The Long-Term View

Recovery from an Achilles rupture is a marathon, not a sprint. The early weeks are about protection and healing. The middle phase (where you are now) is about rebuilding strength and function. The later phases are about returning to sport and preventing rerupture.

Each phase has its own goals and challenges. You're doing well.

## Want more detail?

If you want a full roadmap through the later phases, our [Recovery Course](https://thetismedical.com/course) walks through milestones, rerupture prevention, and returning to sport. We also cover [life after Achilles rupture](https://thetismedical.com/FAQs/life-after-achilles-rupture) in our FAQs.

**Important reminder:** Use any boot or splint exactly as directed by your clinician. They know your specific situation and protocol.

## You're Doing Great

Progress can feel slow, but consistency adds up. You're doing the right things. Keep following your plan, trust your clinicians, and be patient with yourself.

You've got this.

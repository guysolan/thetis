Hi there,

Three weeks in, and life is usually starting to feel more manageable. Depending on your protocol, you may be starting to put more weight through your boot (some people are still partial weight-bearing or using crutches — follow your clinician's plan).

## Walking in Your Boot

**What to expect:**

- **Your gait will feel different** — walking in a boot changes how you move, and that's normal
- **Take it steady** — you're still healing, so don't push too hard
- **Follow your protocol** — continue with your wedge schedule and weight-bearing instructions

**Making it easier:**

- **Wear supportive shoes on your good foot** — helps balance the leg length difference
- **Take breaks** — your leg will get tired; that's normal
- **Elevate when you can** — still important to reduce swelling

## Hygiene and Comfort

**Washing:**

- **If you want to actually wash your foot**, our [Thetis Achilles Rupture Splint](https://thetismedical.com/achilles-rupture-splint) allows you to remove it for washing while keeping your ankle in the correct position
- **Keep your boot clean** — check the liner regularly and use antifungal powder if needed

**Sleep:**

- If you're still struggling to sleep in your boot, the [Thetis Achilles Rupture Splint](https://thetismedical.com/achilles-rupture-splint) can make a huge difference — it's much lighter and more comfortable for sleeping

## The Mental Side

Recovery isn't just physical. It's normal to feel frustrated, anxious, or even a bit down. This injury changes everything, and that's hard.

If you're struggling, talk to someone — a friend, family member, or your clinician. Mental health matters just as much as physical recovery.

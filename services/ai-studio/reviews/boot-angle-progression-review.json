    "feedback": "The image accurately depicts the gradual angle reduction in a walking boot for Achilles tendon rehabilitation. However, it lacks clear differentiation between boot types (Aircast vs VACOped) as mentioned in the course content. The angles and progression seem correct, but more anatomical details could enhance understanding.",

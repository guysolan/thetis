    "score": 7,
    "feedback": "The image generally matches the course content description, illustrating the gradual angle reduction in both Aircast and VACOped boots. However, the image does not explicitly show or label the differences between the Aircast's wedge mechanism and the VACOped's hinge mechanism.",
    "issues": [
      "The image lacks clear differentiation between the Aircast and VACOped mechanisms.",
      "The depiction of angles might not be precise enough for educational purposes."

  "style": {
    "score": 8,
    "feedback": "The style is consistent and appropriate for patient education. The layout is clear, and the colors are professional. However, the visual indication of the boot types could be more explicit.",

      "Consistent use of colors and style with other educational materials.",
      "Arrows and labels are clear and consistent."

    "feedback": "The image is mostly clear, but the lack of explicit distinction between Aircast and VACOped might confuse patients. The layout is logical, but additional explanations could improve comprehension.",
    "strengths": [
      "Logical progression of angles shown.",
      "Clear and professional design."

Procedure:
Recall Decision
The QAM reviews reports of adverse events, complaints, and non-conformities to evaluate the potential for harm and to determine whether a recall is necessary.
If a recall is required, the QAM convenes a Recall Committee including the RC, RAM, and other key personnel to assess the scope and urgency.
Health Canada Notification
The RAM informs Health Canada of the intent to recall as per Section 64 of the Medical Devices Regulations.
The notification includes the nature of the defect, the risk involved, the number and distribution of affected units, and the proposed recall strategy.
Classification of Recall
The Recall Committee categorises the recall according to the risk to health: Class I (high risk), Class II (moderate risk), or Class III (low risk).
This classification guides the depth and urgency of the recall actions.
Development of Recall Strategy
The RC develops a recall strategy that details:
The level of recall (wholesale, retail, user/consumer).
The geographic extent of the recall.
The communication methods to be used.
The method for retrieving and disposing of the recalled product.
The mechanism for tracking the recall progress.
Communication of Recall:
The CST, under the direction of the RC, communicates the recall to distributors, healthcare facilities, and end-users where appropriate.
Communication includes recall notice letters, which provide details on the reason for the recall and the actions recipients should take.
Execution of Recall
The RC, with assistance from the DRO, identifies and contacts all distribution channels to arrange for the return or correction of the affected product.
A system for receiving, processing, and destroying recalled products is established.
Monitoring of Recall
The RC monitors the progress of the recall and provides periodic updates to the Recall Committee.
Efforts are escalated if the rate of product return is insufficient.
Recall Effectiveness Check
The RC assesses the effectiveness of the recall through verification that all known consignees have been notified and have responded.
The Recall Committee reviews the outcome and determines if additional actions are required.
Record-Keeping and Documentation
The RC compiles a detailed summary of the recall process, including decisions made, actions taken, and the final disposition of the recalled product.
Records are maintained as per the regulatory requirements.
Health Canada Reporting
The RAM provides a final report to Health Canada summarizing the recall process and its effectiveness.
Any additional information requested by Health Canada is supplied as needed.
Post-Recall Review and CAPA
The QAM conducts a post-recall review to assess the recall process and identify any needed improvements.
CAPA are identified and implemented to prevent a recurrence of the issue leading to the recall.
Training
Relevant personnel are trained on this recall procedure and kept informed of any updates or changes.
Document Control
This procedure is reviewed regularly and revised as necessary to ensure compliance with current regulations and best practices.
All revisions require approval from the RAM.
This recall procedure ensures that Thetis Medical Ltd responds to potential health risks in a timely, organized, and effective manner in accordance with regulatory expectations, thereby maintaining the trust of customers, regulators, and the public. Compliance with this procedure is mandatory for all employees involved in the recall process.
